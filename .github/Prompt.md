Generate a single-file web page based on the attached earnings call transcript. Use Tailwind CSS (via CDN) for styling to ensure a clean, modern 'fintech' aesthetic that is highly readable.



Layout Requirements:



The View: Use a vertical split-screen layout (60/40 split).



Left Panel (60%): Display the full, verbatim conversation. Do not truncate or summarize this section. Focus on typography (line height, font size) for easy reading. Every question and answer should be seen on the left panel.



Right Panel (40%): Display the analytical content, including the Overall Summary, Key Takeaways, and Variables to Track.



Design & Technical Constraints:



No Visualizations: Do not generate charts, graphs, or complex data visualizations. Present all data using clean typography, cards, lists, or simple tables.



Technical Setup: The output must be a single HTML file containing the Tailwind script (CDN) and any necessary JavaScript.
