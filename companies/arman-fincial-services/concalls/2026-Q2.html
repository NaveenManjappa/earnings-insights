            <p>Yes. Thank you so much, and a very good afternoon to everyone, and thank you for joining us today. On behalf of Arman Financial Services Limited, I extend a warm welcome to all of you to our Q2 and H1 FY '26 earnings call. I am joined by our Group CFO - Mr. Vivek Modi and the Investor Relations team from SGA. I trust you all had the opportunity to review our results, the investor presentation and the press release, which are all available on the stock exchanges and our company website.</p>
            <p>Over the past 5 to 6 quarters, the microfinance industry has navigated a challenging period, marked by elevated credit stress, regulatory reforms and significant write-offs and provisionings. However, now we are beginning to witness the early signs of recovery. The September quarter reflected a moderation in bad loans ratio and an improvement in collection efficiencies, supported by the gradual restoration of borrower discipline. That said, this stabilization in asset quality has not come without its trade-offs. The tighter regulatory guardrails and prudent risk management practices have effectively curtailed overleverage in the system, but also resulted in a slowdown in fresh disbursements.</p>
            <p>Against this backdrop, Q2 and H1 FY '26 have been about steady progress and rebuilding momentum for Arman. The groundwork we laid through disciplined execution, sharper risk controls and structural reforms implemented last year is now beginning to yield tangible results. We are witnessing positive signs across all key operating parameters from AUM and disbursement traction to asset quality and collection efficiency. Our microfinance portfolio has started showing signs of recovery, while our non-MFI segments, which are MSME, Two-Wheeler and LAP, continued to deliver consistent momentum.</p>
            <p>We continued to maintain a calibrated approach in our Microfinance business, while steadily expanding our presence in MSME, Two-Wheeler and LAP segments. Our focus on strengthening portfolio quality, enhancing credit and underwriting processes and driving operational efficiency has positioned us well to capitalize on the ongoing recovery. While the external environment continues to evolve, the underlying trends in our business remain firmly positive. We are encouraged by the resilience demonstrated by our borrowers and teams on the ground, and we remain confident of continuing this momentum as we move into the second half of the year.</p>
            <p>Our consolidated AUM stood at <mark class="bg-emerald-100 text-emerald-800 px-1 rounded font-medium">INR 2,130 crores</mark> as on September 2025, in line with our conscious strategy of prioritizing portfolio quality and risk discipline over headline growth. While this remains lower on a year-on-year basis, the portfolio is now showing encouraging signs of stabilization and a gradual return to growth. Impairment costs have been trending down for 3 consecutive quarters from <mark class="bg-emerald-100 text-emerald-800 px-1 rounded font-medium">INR 89 crores</mark> in Q4 FY '25 to <mark class="bg-emerald-100 text-emerald-800 px-1 rounded font-medium">INR 38 crores</mark> in Q2 FY '26, reflecting healthier repayment behavior and stronger early-stage controls.</p>
            <p>Disbursements during H1 FY '26 stood at <mark class="bg-emerald-100 text-emerald-800 px-1 rounded font-medium">INR 865 crores</mark> compared to <mark class="bg-emerald-100 text-emerald-800 px-1 rounded font-medium">INR 831 crores</mark> in the same period last year, largely remaining flat on a year-on-year basis. For the Q2 FY 26, disbursements were <mark class="bg-emerald-100 text-emerald-800 px-1 rounded font-medium">INR 475 crores</mark>, representing a 26% increase year-on-year and a 21% sequential growth over Q1 FY '26.</p>
            <p>Gross total income for H1 FY '26 stood at INR 310 crores, down by 15% year-on-year basis. For the Q2 FY '26, it increased by 5% sequentially to INR 159 crores and down by 12% over the same quarter previous year. Net total income for H1 FY '26 stood at INR 208 crores, a year-on-year degrowth of 11%. For Q2 FY '26, increased by 11% sequentially to INR 110 crores and saw a degrowth of 6% the same quarter the previous year.</p>
            <p>Pre-Provisioning Operating Profit or PPOP for H1 FY '26 stood at INR 112 crores, year-on-year degrowth of 31%. For Q2 FY '26 remained flat on a sequential basis of INR 56 crores and saw a degrowth of 28% over the same quarter the previous year. For H1 FY '26, we reported a loss of INR 6.6 crores. And for Q2 FY '26 registered a profit of <mark class="bg-emerald-100 text-emerald-800 px-1 rounded font-medium">INR 8 crores</mark> compared to INR 14.6 crores loss in Q1 of FY 26.</p>
            <p>Operationally, asset quality metrics have shown visible improvement. Overall collection efficiency improved to <mark class="bg-emerald-100 text-emerald-800 px-1 rounded font-medium">95.6%</mark> in September, supported by stronger borrower discipline and improved field level monitoring. Asset quality has started to show steady improvement supported by disciplined measures we have taken in place over the last few quarters. Our consolidated GNPA stands at <mark class="bg-emerald-100 text-emerald-800 px-1 rounded font-medium">3.69%</mark> and NNPA of <mark class="bg-emerald-100 text-emerald-800 px-1 rounded font-medium">0.53%</mark>, reflecting signs of normalization.</p>
            <p>As on September 30, capital adequacy was <mark class="bg-emerald-100 text-emerald-800 px-1 rounded font-medium">38.73%</mark> for the stand-alone entity and <mark class="bg-emerald-100 text-emerald-800 px-1 rounded font-medium">57.78%</mark> for Namra Finance, its wholly-owned subsidiary; both well above regulatory requirements. And we also have healthy liquidity position with <mark class="bg-emerald-100 text-emerald-800 px-1 rounded font-medium">INR 238 crores</mark> in cash and bank balances, liquid investments and undrawn CC limits.</p>
            <p>Now moving on to the subsidiary: Namra Finance. Our MFI subsidiary ended September 2025 with an AUM of <mark class="bg-emerald-100 text-emerald-800 px-1 rounded font-medium">INR 1,507 crores</mark>. This is, of course, lower year-on-year, but now showing encouraging signs of stabilization over the last 2 months. Collection efficiency improved in September with zero bucket strengthening to almost 99%. The portfolio created after September 2024 has a 99.4% zero DPD repayment rate, which is as per our expectations.</p>
            <p>Disbursements for Namra Finance during H1 FY '26 stood at INR 605 crores compared to INR 625 crores in the same period last year for 6 months. For Q2 FY '26, disbursements were <mark class="bg-emerald-100 text-emerald-800 px-1 rounded font-medium">INR 335 crores</mark>, representing a 25% increase year-on-year and a 24% sequential growth over Q1 FY '26. This is despite the log-ins versus disbursements percentages still being only about 20%. Gross total income for H1 FY '25 stood at INR 209 crores and for Q2 FY '26 stood at INR 107 crores with a sequential growth of 6% over Q1 FY '26 and down by 22% over Q2 FY '25. Net total income for H1 FY '26 stood at INR 132 crores, down by 22% year-on-year basis.</p>
            <p>In Microfinance, GNPA stands at <mark class="bg-emerald-100 text-emerald-800 px-1 rounded font-medium">3.77%</mark>, improved by 96 basis points and NNPA stands at <mark class="bg-emerald-100 text-emerald-800 px-1 rounded font-medium">0.26%</mark>, an improvement of 39 basis points compared to H1 FY '25. Key driver for this improvement has been the governance and process reforms we have implemented last year, the separation of credit underwriting from recovery functions, which is now operational across 196 or 50% of the branches. This structural change has strengthened accountability, enhanced risk oversight and ensured greater consistency in collection performance.</p>
            <p>As of September 2025, about <mark class="bg-emerald-100 text-emerald-800 px-1 rounded font-medium">67%</mark> of our microfinance portfolio is covered under CGFMU guarantee scheme, providing an additional layer of comfort and risk protection. Overall, we believe the worst of the credit cycle is behind us, and the portfolio is now positioned for a more stable and sustainable footing.</p>
            <p>Coming to our stand-alone business, which is MSME, LAP and Two-Wheeler. The non-MFI business continues to perform in line with expectations and remains our growth engines in these testing times. AUM grew by 29% year-on-year to <mark class="bg-emerald-100 text-emerald-800 px-1 rounded font-medium">INR 623 crores</mark> with disbursements for H1 FY '26 rising to 26% to INR 260 crores compared to H1 FY '25. Disbursements for Q2 FY '26 has grown by 34% on a year-on-year basis to INR 140 crores and saw a 17% growth on a sequential basis. Profit after tax for H1 FY '26 stood at INR 21 crores, registering a growth of 4% over H1 FY '25. For Q2 FY '26, profit grew by 12% on a year-on-year basis to INR 9 crores.</p>
            <p>On asset quality, GNPA stood at 3.86% for MSME, 4.99% for Two-Wheeler. And for LAP, it was 0.16%. Collection efficiency in September stood at 95.4% for MSME, 95.8% for Two-Wheeler, and of course, MFI book, which we discussed earlier, was 95.6%. We continue to strengthen our presence and deepen our reach. We now operate across 11 states with a network of 509 branches serving over 6 lakh customers.</p>
            <p>As we look ahead to the second half of FY '26, we expect the momentum to strengthen further with improvements becoming more visible and broad-based across our businesses. We anticipate continued stabilization in the microfinance asset quality, sustained strength in collection and further moderation in credit cost. Thank you very much. And Muskan, we can now open the floor for questions.</p>

            Sure sir. Thank you so much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question is from the line of Prithviraj Patil from Investec. Please go ahead.

            Thanks for the opportunity. So, I had a couple of questions. Sir, first question was on the capitalization. So, I see that Namra has a higher capitalization than the holding company. So, just wanted to know, do we expect to go back to the prior growth rates in the Microfinance business or do we look to diversify the Namra book going forward? That's the first question.

            <p>That's actually a good question. So, as the portfolio declines, the overall capital adequacy will appear to be better. So, this was money that was pumped down from the holdco into the subsidiary. Now as the portfolio picks up again, I think both those numbers will kind of become more normalized or equivalent as the portfolio increases. Not given it much thought of what we will do in case it doesn't grow or anything like that. Right now, the hope is that things will resume back to normal.</p>

            Okay. And the second question that I had was on the unsecured MSME portfolio. So, you mentioned that 67% of our MFI portfolio is CGFMU insured. So, have we taken any CGTMSE or insurance on our MSME portfolio?

            <p>Yes. Just an update on that. CGFMU cover itself is applicable to NBFCs also. And for the unsecured loans that are under a threshold limit of INR 2 lakhs can be covered in the CGFMU, though there is a separate category for getting registered there., Arman has been given the registration for the same somewhere in September itself. We hope to start subscribing to it as we move in Quarter 3.</p>

            <p>Slightly more expensive for non-MFI book. Now let's not get into why that is the case. I mean, it is what it is. So, we will have to think a little bit more about the MFI portfolio, whether we want to cover it or not. Right now, it seems that we are in favor of doing it. And so that registration got approved, as Vivek said, just in September. And so anything that we want to cover for this quarter, which is Q3 that we don't really have to decide until January or February.</p>

            <p>So, obviously, the yields on the LAP, considering that it's secured, it's going to be lower overall. But hopefully, the OpEx should be lower as well and the risk should be lower as well and the credit cost should be lower as well. So, we have been talking about creating LAP for a while. I think finally, this last credit cycle made us realize that it's important to diversify the book. So, yes, in comparison to, let's say, pure unsecured MSME, the yields look much, much lower. But hopefully, a well-diversified portfolio will create a more healthier company and healthier balance sheet.</p>

            Yes. So, no, my question was that the yields had come down sequentially over the past couple of quarters and the average ticket size had increased, I think. So, I just wanted to know have we recalibrated that portfolio.

              <p>Partially, yes and no, because these are early days in LAP. And till the time we kind of reach a 5,000-10,000 customer base numbers, you will have to kind of keep yourself a bit flexible on these yields as long as you do not go below the threshold limits of, let's say, 18%. I will not do any case below 18%. So, a threshold there has to be defined. But largely, as we move from, say, about INR 3.5 lakhs to INR 4 lakhs average ticket when we started it off to about INR 5 lakhs to about INR 7 lakhs today. You are doing slightly larger tickets, and obviously, that market is finding acceptance at more competitive rates.</p>

            Hi, thanks for the opportunity. Hi Aalok. It's really heartening to hear that things have improved. So, I just wanted to get more color on the growth part of the book now. So, in the previous cycles, whenever we would come out of a crisis, Arman typically would step that paddle on the growth and the numbers would really be a little aggressive than the Street. And in your commentary, you mentioned stable growth. So, is this different this time? Are you approaching this cycle a little differently?

            <p>See, the previous credit cycles were slightly different, where they were caused by external events, whether it was de-mon or COVID. This time, it is slightly different. And what I personally feel is the lesson to be learned is that go calibrated, don't go crazy. Honestly, I don't know what the growth pattern will look like.</p>
            <p>Typically speaking, whenever we are recovering from a crisis, we are well positioned to grow faster than many of our peers. So, on average, there might be a few companies, maybe better run companies who are doing better than us, and that's fair. But many times, there are many more companies who have still not come out of the crisis. Their liquidity is low. They are managing leadership issues, liquidity issues, attrition issues, many other things. And so we have sort of an ability to grab market share. So, that will be the goal this time where hopefully, we can repeat that. So, there might be a temporarily accelerated growth on the AUM. But in the long run, I think the lesson learned here is that, don't go too crazy. I don't think there is any industry in the world that can sustain 35%, 40% growth indefinitely. And a slow and calibrated approach is probably more of a long-term goal here.</p>
            <p>Now that said, the great part about India is that people have very short-term memories. So, good or bad news, it may be that in a year or two, people will forget whatever happened and kind of go back to the usual antics, myself included. So, who knows? Let's see.</p>

            Thanks for this. My second question is on the asset quality, especially on the MSME side, where some of the listed companies have flagged off some asset quality issues due to the spillover from MFI. Are you seeing that stress in your markets where you are present on the MSME side? And is that improving?

            <p>I don't think it's improving. It's probably at this point, I would call it, stable. But I said it in the last con call and I said it in the previous con call also. So, at least for 3 quarters that MSME is not immune to the overall macroeconomics of the rural segment, especially for us.</p>
            <p>So, the term MSME is actually very broad. When somebody says MFI, they know exactly what you are talking about. MSME is micro, small and medium. So, it can be urban, it can be rural, it can be secured, unsecured, whatever it is. So, there are many flavours of MSME. The kind of MSME that we are doing, which is small ticket rural MSME loans, unsecured. That is obviously not going to be immune to whatever is happening in MFI. But as I said for whatever reason, the damage which was there in MSME is significantly lower than MFI, theory for that, but I will kind of hold on to that thought. But definitely, there is stress there, not as much as MFI, and it's something that we are tracking closely. And that's why it's important, carried away in any of our business.</p>

            Thank you. And Aalok, just one last question is on the yields, because some of the peers have taken a hike on the yields, trying to capture the risk for the business. Are you also looking at that vector where to price the risk better, you might have to take a hike on your yields? Any thoughts there?

            <p>So, that is something on the table. However, we have avoided it so far because pricing is very sensitive to regulators and many other external stakeholders. And so as much as we can manage without raising the pricing, I think that will be a better strategic decision. But it's not off the table. If it comes, I am hopeful.</p>

            Good afternoon, sir. And thanks for giving the opportunity. Sir, continuing on the previous MSME question. So, we are seeing higher NPAs and higher credit costs. So, how do you see it settling, and if you can give some color on the provisions that we have undertaken in this book across the stages.

So, carrying about 90% provisions on those. As compared to that, again, the good part is that largely 1 to 90 buckets have come down marginally in the last quarter. So, these are more or less stable. But even if that continues to be close around 3%, then there is a scope for improvement. And in that stage, which we would probably call a Stage-2, the provision coverage would be about 45% to 50%.</p>

            Yes. And do you expect these numbers to hold on to these levels? Like you mentioned that it will stabilize at these levels. And also, you have not grown it much. So, MFI disbursement growth rate is 20%, but here in MSME, we have maybe done only 12% 13%. So, do you still see this number inching up and that is why the disbursement growth rate is lower or going forward...

                <p>Yes. So, from that standpoint, you are partially right in spotting that, that as we kind of embark upon our journey on the secured LAP. a lot of our good customers who performed well in their earlier cycles kind of move upwards into secured LAPs, plus a lot of customers, as long as we were not doing LAP, we would have probably converted them into high-ticket unsecured MSME earlier before we had started LAP. To that extent, the growth numbers taken together for the LAP and MSME would really give a true picture for the field operations rather than just looking at only the unsecured MSME.</p>
                <p>So, Sarvesh, to further add to that, what is also happening is that geographically, this year, we have taken our footprint to North. We have opened a few branches in UP in the last quarter, and we will try to expand our footprint as the year goes by in that geography. So, to a certain extent, the MSME will get a good bump up, because of the geographical outreach getting increased.</p>

                <p>So, I mean one of the previous callers also was, I say MSME has performed significantly better than MFI, and I have my theories why, but I won't get into it. See why it has performed better is because we took a sort of a calibrated approach to growth without a lot of pressure. So, we were more concentrating on quality. And so, where the opportunities were there, we grew. We were never really pressured that we will need to do so much growth.</p>
                <p>And so to a certain extent, that protected us over multiple cycles, I should say. And so, I am not really, really going to push disbursements in MSME. Of course, and also the fact, as you mentioned, that segment is also under some level of stress. So, right now is not really the time to push so hard on the disbursements.</p>

            <p>How does one push the disbursements? I mean even today, I am trying to disburse, if there is a good customer who wants a loan, my job is to give him that loan. The only way you can really bump up the disbursement is kind of go easy on the underwriting or change your underwriting strategies here and there, stop being so much selective. So, we are monitoring those data points, based on scoring and qualitative and quantitative factors of how they are performing.</p>
            <p>But I don't think I am ready yet to say, things are great and time to hit the accelerator. No. I mean this crisis has always been about two steps forward and one step back. And so yes, in the last quarter, we have taken two steps forward, but who knows when the next step back will be. So, no, I don't think we are ready to floor it at this point. But I am a lot more comfortable to go faster, let's just put it that way.</p>

                Aalok, I missed the first 10, 15 minutes. So, if I repeat something, sorry. I just wanted to understand about a year back, maybe a little less, we put a credit officer in the MFI business also. So, wanted your feedback on how you are feeling about that measure, and the book that is originated after that move in those branches or any anecdotal feedback you have on what has been the on-ground performance after this measure?

              <p>Yes. So, we compare BCM versus non-BCM disbursements. So, largely, I think there is 40% lower delinquencies in the BCM originated cases versus non-BCM originated cases. So, there is clearly a correlation. Now whether the cost of the BCM justifies, that is the later date, that I am not going to think about at this point. But definitely, there is an advantage. And that advantage is increasing as the experience increases.</p>
              <p>So, the microfinance of tomorrow is not going to be guardrail based. It's not going to be one-size-fits-all base. So, if you borrow INR 2 lakhs, it is good. INR 2,01,000 automatically customer becomes bad. No. I don't believe that. I think there are good customers at even INR 5 lakh outstanding and there are bad customers at even INR 50,000. So, you cannot create one rule to underwrite every single MFI customer in India.</p>
              <p>And so, the BCMs, I feel will serve more, it will allow better strategic calls later on. And today, already, we are doing it in IL loans and other things where customers that we find who are 750-plus credit scores, 8-year history, never a single day late, good business. Why should I reject that customer? I mean that's an amazing customer. But you need that ground level people to give you that confidence, right? Otherwise, until that conflict of interest exists between operations and credit, you will never be able to make that decision sitting at HO okay, whether that guy is good or not.</p>

            Hello. Thank you for the opportunity. Sir, just wanted to understand how are the trends shaping up in October and November. Because I remember in Q4 also, we had seen very good recovery, but then Q1 was slightly subdued and Q2 has been strong again. So, just wanted to understand how Q3 shaped up so far. That was the first question.

            <p>Yes. So, that's what I said also, I think, a couple of questions ago that this crisis has always been about making two steps forward and one step back. So, we have taken two steps forward. Diwali was good. Festive was good. September, October, growth were high in terms of disbursement, demand was quite high. Despite having overall log-in versus disbursement was only 20%. So, only 20% of log-ins we are still disbursing, which is very, very low. Still the disbursement, I think, in MFI was 140.</p>

            <p>Almost 140. One of the highest in the last 6, 7 months that we had seen. Again, just to add to that, Aalok. This quarter 3 would also be pitched against a very low quarter 3 numbers for the sector last year. So, to that extent, I think October being good gives us a kind of a bump up for the quarter 3. So, that way, from a comparative basis, Y-o-Y basis, quarter 3 could turn out to be technically much better.</p>

            Got it, sir. Thank you for the detailed answer. The second question was on the SRs that we have. So, how is the recovery going there? And like what is the current outstanding SR? And what was the provision that we carry against it?

            <p>Firstly, the entire SR that we invested in to begin with in March '25 was about INR 31 crores. On the pool, there has been a recovery of about INR 8.5 crores in the last 6 months. And obviously, the structure requires trust fees and all those things after accounting for that. The INR 31 crores of SRs today, as of September stand at about INR 25.5 crores.</p>
            <p>And to that extent, I think the recovery on the pool is fair as we would have wished to. The pool also went through that first rating process and the rating that has been assigned to the pool is RR1, which means that the expected recovery from the pool is going to be 100% to 150% of the book value. So, it's going in the right direction to a certain extent.</p>

            Hi Aalok. Congrats on a good set of numbers. So, just wanted to understand on your MSME portfolio, like when we see the yield from MSME of 34% versus MFI of 20%. Does this indicate a more riskier customer or how should we look at that product?

            <p>If time has taught us anything, they are probably less riskier than the MFI customers. So, no, it's not a function of risk, it's a function of supply and demand and what the customer can tolerate and many other factors. Fortunately, it started as being a function of risk. But today, the customers that we deal with really are not very, very price sensitive.</p>

                Good afternoon, sir. I have a small question. You can also call it advice sort of. Sir, in the future, in the next coming 2, 4 years, I think there will only be two types of companies. One which use AI for their business, and one which doesn't use AI for their business. Even using AI, one employee can do work of 10 employees. So, slowly and steadily AI will be affecting all of the businesses in the future. So, just wanted to ask whether you have any planning of incorporating AI into your business flows and models for financial decisions?

              <p>So, I think you could be right. I take AI as an amazing tool as good as the Internet. But as long as you require people on the ground to knock on doors, AI is not going to do that. Where it can help us is on stuff like evaluations, back-end processes, IT, tracking. And to many extent, we have been doing that.</p>
              <p>So, with due respect to you, sir, I think you are right about AI being a very important factor in our daily lives in the coming years. I think there are right places to use it in my business today. And wherever those places are, we will use it. As the technology evolves, if there are other places to use it, I am committed to using that as well. But certainly, I am not going to jump the gun, and do anything without being convinced that it's the right move.</p>

            <p>I mean, that could also be there. But the earlier question there was the breakup of the provisions. So, for the consolidated, the write-off was about INR 134 crores for the H1. And there were reversals of credit losses to the extent of INR 29.62 crores. And that kind of makes up for the entire provision cum write-off of INR 104.78 crores.</p>
