            Good afternoon, everyone, and a warm welcome to all of you joining
            us for our quarter two FY '26 financial results discussion call. I'm
            pleased to be joined today by our COO, Mr. Rajesh Jain. I hope you
            had a happy and a safe Diwali. Before I start, it is honoured to
            announce the leadership transition of Shri Rajesh Jain to Chief
            Operating Officer, following an exploring tenure as our Chief
            Financial Officer; and Shri Jigar Mehta, previously Vice President,
            Finance as our Chief Financial Officer. I extend my warmest
            congratulations to them as they step into their new roles.
            <br /><br />
            The second quarter has been particularly encouraging for R R Kabel
            as we delivered robust growth, both in revenue and profitability.
            This strong performance was primarily driven by the resilience and
            expansion of our core wires and cable business, which remains the
            backbone of our company's growth strategy. The wires and cable
            industry continued to perform well, supported by several economical
            drivers, robust construction activity, infrastructure expansion,
            renewable energy expansion, government focus on electrification and
            healthy demand from both institutional and retail markets.
            <br /><br />
            R R Kabel has leveraged these trends to deliver another quarter of
            consistent growth driven by strong traction across product
            categories and sustained operational discipline, enabling margin
            expansion. Our focus on high quality, safety standards, value-added
            offerings and compliance with global quality benchmarks has further
            strengthened our market position, which helped us maintain healthy
            momentum across regions and end markets.
            <br /><br />
            In the FMEG segment, market conditions remained challenging,
            particularly in fans and appliances, while switches and lighting
            products have performed better. Despite softer demand and seasonal
            headwinds, we have maintained steady performance, reflecting
            operational discipline and the strength of our diversified
            portfolio. Our continued efforts in product optimization, cost
            efficiency and network expansion have yielded visible results.
            Overall, quarter two FY '26 marked a quarter of solid progress for R
            R Kabel year-on-year, as well as sequentially. We are confident that
            we'll be able to continue to deliver sequential growth in all
            parameters in second half of the year as well. With this, I'd like
            to hand over the call to Mr. Rajesh Jain to take this call further.
            Thank you, everyone.

          <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
            Thanks, Mahendraji. At the onset, I'm grateful to the Board and our
            leadership for their trust and support over the years. In my new
            role as COO, I will continue to work to sustain R R Kabel's strong
            growth trajectory and deliver value to all our stakeholders. India's
            growth story remains strong. The second quarter saw stable GDP
            momentum, supported by government infrastructure spending, healthy
            private capex and gradually improving consumer sentiment. While
            inflation moderated and rural demand is showing early signs of
            recovery, the broader industrial ecosystem remained cautious due to
            input cost fluctuation and uneven weather condition. Nonetheless,
            the electrical and construction sectors continued to benefit from
            ongoing infrastructure investments, housing growth and urban
            electrification projects, all of which form the foundation of R R
            Kabel's long-term opportunity.
            <br /><br />
            The Indian wire and cable industry is also witnessing a shift
            towards organized and branded players driven by highlighted consumer
            awareness around safety, efficiency and compliance. R R Kabel with
            its deep distribution network and premium product positioning is
            well aligned to capture this transition. Furthermore, export demand
            remains healthy, supported by rising global preference for Indian
            manufactured cables that adhere to international standards and
            certifications. In this favourable environment, R R Kabel has
            delivered another quarter of consistent growth and operational
            excellence. Our continuous focus on value-added, energy-efficient
            and safety compliant products continues to differentiate R R Kabel
            in a competitive landscape.
            <br /><br />
            Our revenue from operations for the quarter stood at INR 2,163.8
            crores, representing a solid 19.5% year-on-year growth, compared to
            INR 1,810.1 crores in Q2 FY '25. This growth was primarily driven by
            robust performance in the wires and cables business, where we
            achieved healthy volume expansion and improved realization. This
            segment saw a 16% volume increase, reflecting both institutional
            demand and the continued trust of retail consumers. For the first
            half of FY '26, revenue grew at 16.7% year-on-year, marking the
            highest ever half yearly revenue in the company's history.
            <br /><br />
            On the profitability front, EBITDA rose sharply to INR 176.1 crores,
            an increase of 105.8% year-on-year from INR 85.6 crores in Q2 FY
            '25. The EBITDA margin expanded to 8.1% from 4.7% in the previous
            year due to operating leverage, reflecting better cost absorption
            and sustained efficiency initiatives across the procurement and
            production chain. Our ability to manage cost pressures while
            maintaining quality has been a key differentiator in an otherwise
            competitive market. For the first half of FY 26, EBITDA reached INR
            319.2 crores, up 76.4% year-on-year with margin expanding to 7.6%,
            compared to 5% in the same period last year.
            <br /><br />
            Moving to the bottom-line. Profit after tax for the quarter stood at
            INR 116.3 crores, registering a 134.7% year-on-year increase from
            INR 49.5 crores in Q2 FY '25. PAT margin expanded by 264 basis
            points, reached 5.4%, compared to 2.7% last year. On a half yearly
            basis, we reported our highest ever H1 PAT of INR 206 crores, up
            80.9% year-on-year with margins improving by 173 basis points to
            4.9%. Overall, Q2 FY '26 has been a quarter of solid progress,
            demonstrating the strength of our core business, disciplined
            execution and robust demand environment.
            <br /><br />
            In terms of segment performance, the wires and cable business
            remains the primary growth engine. The segment reported revenue of
            INR 1,971.2 crores in Q2 FY 26, up 22.3% from INR 1,611.8 crores in
            Q2 FY '25. For the first half, the segment delivered INR 3,804.7
            crores, a growth of 19.3% year-on-year. Segment profit rose sharply
            to INR 180.4 crores, more than double from INR 81.8 crores in the
            same quarter last year, supported by a 16% volume increase and
            stronger realization. Our business benefited from consistent
            institutional demand and a firm retail base, supported by efficient
            execution and cost optimization.
            <br /><br />
            The FMEG segment, on the other hand, experienced a marginal decline
            in revenue, recording INR 192.6 crores compared to INR 198.3 crores
            in Q2 FY '25. While the broader market environment remained
            challenging for fans and appliances, a festive-led recovery is
            underway. Our efforts towards product rationalization, operational
            efficiency and cost control helped keep losses largely stable. We
            remain confident that with the ongoing improvements in channel reach
            and brand strengthening, the segment will continue to its path
            towards gradual recovery and profitability. Our working capital has
            remained stable during the period with debtors days being in line
            with previous periods.
            <br /><br />
            Inventory levels were increased to increase consumer demand and
            ensure uninterrupted supply amid rising demand. On the demand front,
            domestic sales continued to drive growth during the quarter,
            supported by increased spending in housing and construction as well
            as steady industrial and infrastructure activity. Export demand also
            improved, particularly from key markets, reflecting our efforts of
            diversify geography and expand our global footprint.
            <br /><br />
            Looking ahead, we remain optimistic about the outlook for the second
            half of FY '26 and expect the second half to do better than first
            half. The underlying demand environment continued to be favorable,
            supported by government infrastructure initiative, the ongoing
            formalization of the electrical sector and increasing consumer
            preference for branded energy-efficient products. R R Kabel remains
            focused on deepening its distribution reach, expanding export
            footprint and introducing technologically advanced products that
            cater to emerging sectors. Our strategic investment in automation,
            digital sales enablement and brand building will continue to
            strengthen our leadership in the industry. With this, I would
            request to open the floor for questions-and-answers.

              Congratulations for good set of numbers. My question is, if I look
              at the performance over the last two quarter to three quarters, we
              have been probably doing well on the margin side. On wires and
              cables EBIT margins, we last year exited at close to around 7.4%.
              And currently, we seem to be on the upward trajectory. So, how
              should we look at the margin performance? H2 should be similar to
              Q2 levels or H1 levels and probably the volume growth that we have
              registered during the quarter two. That momentum continues even in
              October and probably that should be expected in second half, how
              confident we are on that based on the current visibility?

              Thanks, Manoj, for your question. Like last year, we had EBIT
              margins of 7.4% in our wires and cable business. And at the same
              time, we had targeted to improve by almost 100 basis points and we
              are very happy to share that we have achieved this target in first
              half also. At the same time, now also we have our plan to improve
              these margins and maintain the volume growth and even to do and
              achieve our target of 18% volume growth, what we have defined in
              our Project Rise. So, with that, we are quite confident that our
              H2 will be better than H1, what we have achieved.

              Glad to hear that. Sir, lastly, if you look at probably the
              inventories that you just highlighted, so is it just a near-term
              thing and probably should we expect the working capital going back
              to normal cash flows turning positive at the end of the year?

              Yes. So, if we see only from cash flow point of view, of course,
              it is like a little bit on negative side. But at the same time, it
              will get normalized by this year-end. And if we see like inventory
              or our debtor's level, it is in line with our expected levels what
              we have planned, and like whatever levels we have, like net
              working capital of 57 days, we'll maintain those levels.

              Thanks, Praveen. See, when you see this margin improvement, we are
              comparing with last year Q2 FY '25, which as I already told, that
              was not very normal. But when you compare with my yearly gross
              margins of last year also, we have seen a good improvement and
              this is sustainable. And this we have achieved through my better
              product mix and like whatever efficiency control we are bringing
              in our operations. So, these are maintainable and sustainable
              margins, and we'll keep achieving and improving in this front.
              There is no impact or larger impact on the copper prices.

              Congratulations for strong results. Sir, the first question I
              have, you've said that exports have grown 20% Y-o-Y. And
              particularly, you've made a comment that Europe and Middle East
              continue to do well. So, if you could give us some sense in terms
              of what is the mix in terms of regions? Where the customer
              additions and see if any further certifications or additions on
              approvals we have seen? And how do you see this exports growth?
              Will that be absolutely in sync with the overall growth? Or do you
              think there could be an opportunity to have a much larger growth?

              So in export, if you remember, like earlier, we were having some
              exports of around 8% to U.S. also. And there were like some talk
              and some disturbance due to tariff challenges also. But still,
              since we have very diversified export market, and so we were able
              to get or compensate it through our existing market and new
              customers also. Still like most of our sales in export is coming
              from Europe and Middle East, which is almost 75% to 80% of revenue
              coming. At the same time, like we are making very good efforts for
              new approvals and new market. And we hope that, again, U.S. market
              very soon, it will be on a normalized basis, and we'll have higher
              growth from those markets also.

              No. Not disproportionate, but like U.S., if it was like 8%,
              contributing 8%, so contribution might have reduced by another 2%.
              But at the same time, whatever growth we achieved was from new or
              new markets and new customers, which are in Europe and Middle East
              only.

              Okay. Okay. The second question I have is given the significant
              increase in the aluminum and copper price, particularly copper
              price, if you could give us some sense, how does it impact us,
              particularly on the export front? Do you see margin pressure on an

              So if copper prices remains keep increasing, then there may be
              some impact. But what happens since we are focusing on our change
              in product mix also in exports, now we are having more focus where
              like products like cable or special wires where we have higher
              margins. So, it will get be covered or rather improved from export
              market also. And these copper prices are always volatility is
              always part of our business. But at the same time, we are on right
              to improve our margins by changing product mix in favorable

              So Dhruv, if you see, we are already like almost 70% utilization

              our growth plan, we have planned our capex in such a way that we
              keep meeting our projections of getting higher growth in cables

              See, in power cables, majority of the operations like wire drawing

              Sure, sir. Sir, my second question is on your market share in
              certain specific states. So, at the time of the IPO, you had
              highlighted certain key states in the south and the eastern
              markets where your market share was less than 5%. Just want to get
              a sense of how is the progress in terms of market share gain, and
              incrementally, is there enough opportunity in those states for you
              to continue gaining market share or are you at a reasonable level
              in that sense and incrementally growth will be closer to the
              market growth in those states?

              So still our major growth is coming from our strong markets, which
              is west and north only. But at the same time, since we have a very
              good establishment or setup of distributor dealer in south and
              other East geography also in some states. So there, we are looking
              or we have seen a good growth, but still it is overall having very
              less contribution in my overall market share. So, you cannot see a
              very significant growth, but we are in line with our master plan
              and we will keep focusing on new states or states where my market
              share is below less than 5%.

              through, which is also catering to the higher voltages, is it safe
              to say that your institutional share of the volume will go up

              majority of the investment is also coming in that segment only.
              So, we'll see a good increase of share from that segment. At the
              same time, that will improve our margins also. It is not that,

              margins by FY 28. At the same time, if you see we have targeted an
              improvement of 100 basis points in this year, and we are in line
              with our project. And since normally, second half of this industry
              remains always better looking to the demand and industry behavior.
              So, we are quite hopeful to sustain or rather improve these

              No. What I was saying was that when I look at R R Kabel into two
              parts, pre-IPO and post-IPO, pre-IPO, we used to compound at a
              very strong rate every two, three years, four years, we used to
              double. And then there was a phase post-IPO where we had a
              struggle for growth. And last two, three quarters, we are seeing
              the same growth path coming back again, which R R Kabel was used
              to. What has happened in the last two, three, four quarters? And
              how sustainable we are looking at it? If you can just help us

              So my first question, whether we have taken any price hike in Q2
              or any price hike anticipation over the next one or two quarters?
              Because due to commodity price rises, one of our competitors have
              like mentioned 3% price hike in this quarter, especially in Q3.
              And secondly, in that within domestic business, which end markets
              are driving growth, especially residential, real estate,
              industrial and infrastructure or renewable? And how we are
              positioned to capitalize on the government infrastructure push,
              especially PLI scheme, smart cities and power distribution
              reforms?

            <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
              Yes. So, thanks for your question. See, price hike is a regular
              process of our business, and it is not about hike or rejection. It
              is related with our raw material prices, which is copper and
              aluminum. And in practice, what happened, if there is any major
              hike, say, more than 3%, either positive or negative, then we have
              to change the prices. So, in last quarter, we have seen almost
              three to four new price list at the same time. So it is like a
              continuous process, and it had to be connected, with the raw
              material price movement rather than a price hike in separate.
              Secondly, like since we have like our major growth plan and
              focusing in new product categories where right now our major
              contribution is coming from building wire. But at the same time,
              we have very good capex plan for cables and the growth will come
              from like infrastructure development, data center or export
              geography where we have seen a very good demand for cables -
              Indian cable products. So, our overall growth will come from -- in
              India also and in export also, the growth what we can foresee in
              infrastructure investment or specialized cable utilization.

              One is regarding the demand in retail market. Of course, we have
              seen a good momentum in Indian economy. And after GST 2.0 also, it
              is expected that people will have more savings and the customer
              spending will increase. And of course, this will increase our
              overall product demand also, especially wire and cable or be it
              FMEG also. So, with the whenever economy do better, we'll have
              better chances to get more demand in retail market. At the same
              time, investment in our B2B category also and a very good growth
              is coming in infrastructure investment or export market. So, this
              is like seems a sustainable growth over next three, four years.

              Okay. I have another question from Mr. Jain. As input cost and
              channel dynamics keeps on shifting, how are you planning to
              protect the margin? And what cost levers do you think will remain
              strong over the next few quarters? I'm just trying to understand
              how are you going to balance short-term volatility with long-term
              margin stability?

              So, like since we have like a very big plan for our expansion
              cable expansion where this -- we are a very small player in B2B
              segment. And once we keep enhancing our capacity, leveraging our
              cost structure. As you know, like right now, we are a very small
              player in cable business. And once I expand my capacity, then my
              overall efficiency will improve, my price levels will increase,
              and we'll keep improving margins. So, in longer term, like right
              now, our margins are on the lower side, but at the same time,
              we'll be at par with industry level and keep improving these
              margins through operating leverage as well as higher profit giving
              products and everything.

              So my first question is that in case of wire and cables, like we
              saw that like INR 1 lakh crores market cap company, they are
              growing either at par with us or sometimes better than us. Now, we
              are able to catch up with them. So why in that case, even a

              See, our overall strategy is that how we keep ahead of the

              when you see on short-term or quarter-on-quarter basis, there may
              be some deviation. But still, when you see our master plan or our

              also -- since we are expecting a volume growth of 18%, so it will
              be better than industry average. And this, we are trying to get

              Congratulations on a good set of numbers. Sir, I just wanted to
              understand, how are we separating ourselves from the competition
              in the FMEG segment, especially so that we can get a good growth
              in this segment. It's a very competitive segment as far as I
              understand. So, are our products different or is our pricing
              different? What is our edge in the FMEG segment specifically?

              Yes. So, there are two, three points. If you see even in the last
              two years, we have grown much ahead of the industry average, and
              that was due to a separate focus on our FMEG business where we
              have a separate CEO and we have a separate distribution line. What
              we understand that FMEG business is quite different from wire and
              cable business where you need to have a different kind of product.
              And at the same time, we are making a big investment in our R&D
              team, keep introducing new products and in last two years, apart
              from economy category also, now we have introduced a good number
              of products in premium and mid-premium category. So, in that way,
              we are ahead of the industry and getting this good growth and
              improvement in our margins as well.

              Okay. Just a follow-up on this. Since we've already had some good
              growth, as you say, are you confident that competition will not be
              intensifying over the next medium-term because consumption is
              increasing and there's capacity additions in all major players,
              especially in FMEG. So, any further color on how do we sort of
              separate ourselves in the mind of the consumer? Like why would I
              go for an R R Kabel fan or some other fan?

              We will achieve through better products in terms of quality,
              having good prices so that consumer can get attracted to R R Kabel
              FMEG products. And still, if you see by having right product mix,
              investing in R&D, we'll keep growing better than industry. And our
              products will be different from market and get good improvement in
