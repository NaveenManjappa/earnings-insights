            Thank you, Shruti. Good afternoon, friends. I extend a very warm
            welcome to all participants in this Q4 and FY 25 earnings call.

          <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
            Many of us would have interacted in the past, yet I introduce myself
            once again as C. Bhaskar, Managing Director and Chief Executive

            Mr. Vinay Kumar Agarwal, our President, Finance and Chief Financial

            ago of hosting this annual conference call for our investor
            community with the intent of keeping investors and analysts familiar

            As many of us have already had opportunity to meet on earlier calls,
            or at the AGM, or otherwise, I shall not dwell on introducing our
            company. I must add that we are transparent in our approach, but
            must state that all discussions here will be within boundaries
            reasonably imposed by our strategic and competitive position and, of
            course, legal requirements as may be applicable.

            Now coming to a quick review of key business matters. The Indian
            economy has been resilient despite the environment of elevated trade
            protectionist and tariff-related uncertainties. Global growth
            aspirations continue to face significant headwinds with policy
            shocks, uncertainty, and indifferent consumer sentiment. These have
            also prompted the IMF and the other global financial institutions to
            revise global growth projections downwards. However, despite its own
            challenges, the Indian economy expects to grow at over 6% on the
            back of policies and a consolidating role as a geopolitical
            alternative.

          <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
            Further, in the context of the company's investment being undertaken
            in the United Arab Emirates, we are optimistic about the growing
            integration of UAE-based manufacturing into global supply chains.
            More specifically and coming to our performance during Q4 and 2025,
            I'm happy to state that the company continued to deliver a strong
            performance, reflecting our manufacturing and marketing capabilities
            and our strong track record as a key supplier to both the white
            goods and dielectric segments.

          <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
            The dielectric films market continues to expand, driven by demand
            from sectors such as electric vehicles, renewable energy and
            consumer electronics, besides conventional segments in the
            electrical industry. Xpro's dielectric films were consistently in
            demand and has always remained in a strong competitive zone. The
            Barjora dielectric film line operated near full capacity, continuing
            its strategic shift towards thinner and higher-value variants.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
            Pricing has to remain dynamic and flexible to retain market traction
            in a frequently volatile scenario, even at the risk of occasional
            impact on margins. Further, for alignment of available capacity and
            domestic demand, exports were temporarily moderated.

            To drive long-term business value, we prioritize fundamental growth
            over short-term targets. Our strategy for increasing business value
            focuses on organic growth. The company is strengthening its
            leadership position in niche markets, leveraging its marketing --
            manufacturing and development expertise, marketing strength and
            industry relationships. Our key initiatives include global capacity
            scaling, product innovation and cost competitiveness.

            The first of new lines, which would essentially double capacity at
            the existing facility at Barjora, experienced supply and
            logistics-related delays and is now approaching full commissioning.
            The second line to be installed at our subsidiary, Xpro Dielectric
            Films FZ-LLC in the free zone at Ras Al Khaimah, UAE. Factory
            construction and other project implementation work is proceeding to
            plan, while significant portions of the core equipment are already
            at site, taking into account long equipment delivery periods, which
            incidentally is the critical path activity for this investment.

            products are usually custom-made to customer needs and based on
            various polymers. including ABS, polystyrene and PP. Steps were
            initiated towards rationalizing and enhancing sheet and liner
            production capacities at both production units via acquisition and
            integration of production lines from another operator and capacity

            Considering Q4 performance, Revenue from operations during the
            quarter was INR158.21 crores, against INR128.41 crores in Q4 FY '24,
            registering a growth of almost 23% on a year-on-year basis. The
            increase in the top line reflects consistent demand and a strong
            market position, particularly in the Coex businesses. PBT for the
            quarter was INR11.51 crores against INR16.52 crores in Q4 FY '24.
            Biax division reported increase in revenue to a little over INR39.33
            crores in the quarter, as compared to INR38 crores in the
            corresponding previous quarter, more or less flat. The Coex division
            reported a healthy growth in revenue of over 32%, to over INR118.9
            crores as against INR90.3 crores in the corresponding previous
            quarter.

            Now coming to the full FY '25 performance. The company reaffirmed
            its operational resilience in a volatile business environment marked
            by supply chain worries, rising costs, geopolitical tensions,
            underscoring the efficacy of the operational strategies and the
            competitive trends. Production volumes rose by 18.4% to 33,014 tons,
            against 27,891 tons in the previous year. The net sales reached an
            all-time high of INR535.28 crores, demonstrating a 15% increase over
            the previous year's INR465.41 crores.

            The company endures as the domestic market leader and the pioneering
            Indian manufacturer of premium dielectric BOPP films, recognized in
            external markets for quality, innovation, and service. The
            dielectric film line operated near full capacity with domestic
            market share at over 30%, continuing its strategic direction towards
            thinner and higher-value variants. Pricing, however, has to remain
            dynamic and flexible to retain market traction in a frequently
            volatile scenario.

            Aggregate production for coextruded sheets and thermoform liners
            increased by 25%, reflecting resilient consumer durables markets,
            particularly for refrigerators. Our production capacities, as
            mentioned earlier, were rationalized via integration of acquired
            equipment, which we had actually purchased from a competing
            manufacturer earlier in the year. Operating profitability was
            impacted at times due to strategic competitive pricing, geopolitical
            tensions, and input cost volatility, marked by supply chain worries
            and higher expenses necessary for the buildup ahead of expansion
            capacities going on stream. Our quality and service levels remain

            During the year, revenues of Biax dipped marginally to INR141 crores
            from INR149 crores in the previous year. Revenues from the Coex
            division increased on the other hand, by almost 25% to INR393.86
            crores, as compared to INR315.69 crores in the previous year.
            Revenues from export were marginally higher at INR14.2 crores, as
            against INR13.44 crores in the previous year. EBITDA stood at
            INR72.88 crores against INR78.34 crores in the previous year.
            Interest and other finance costs were lower at INR4.38 crores,
            including INR1.2 crores of adjusted borrowing cost incurred for the
            new project, against INR5 crores in the previous year and after
            depreciation the PBT stood at INR58 crores as against INR60 crores
            in the INR60.16 crores in the previous year.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
            I must mention that there are no outstanding long-term borrowings
            for existing operations. However, we have opted from a financial
            perspective, particularly the interest savings that would accrue in
            future years to go in for a supplier credit in the nature of an ECB
            for the new line being installed at Barjora and accordingly, there
            was an increase in long-term debt to the extent of INR110 crores,
            fundamentally towards the supplier credit. During FY '25, the net
            debt to equity stood at 0.19x and delivered a healthy ROE on
            expanded capital of 7.44%, and a return on capital employed of
            8.33%. The Board has recommended for member approval a dividend of
            INR2 per equity share on the expanded capital of the company.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
            Some mention on capital raising. In 2023-24, 14,35,750 warrants
            which had been allotted on a preferential basis to 12 subscribers,
            including 1,05,750 warrants to two promoter group entities at an
            issue price of INR975 per warrant, with an initial payment of 35% of
            the warrant price and balance 65% payable at warrant holders' option
            anytime within 18 months from allotment. Each fully-paid warrant
            entitled subscription to an allotment of 1 equity share of INR10 of
            the company at a premium of INR965. During the year, 4 subscribers,
            including 2 promoter group entities, exercised their options well
            ahead of the final date of payment, by payment of the balance of 65%
            and were accordingly allotted a total of 2,65,750 equity shares.
            Following this, the capital of the company stands at INR22.30
            crores, comprising of 2,23,00,391 equity shares of INR10 each.
            Assuming full conversion of outstanding warrants when they are fully
            paid up, the equity capital would rise to INR23.47 crores, which
            should happen by end July 2025.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
            I confirm that the capital raised through 2 preferential issues and
            a QIP during earlier years, 2022-23 and 23-24 is being utilized for
            the purpose stated and is monitored as required. The promoter group
            has invested in both preferential offers and opted for earlier
            conversion of warrants and is subject to longer lock-in period than
            other investors. Any prima-facie dilution in promoter holdings,
            presently at 42.43%, has been purely a consequence of allotments
            made to others.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
            Now let me update you on the status of the capacity additions. Given
            the technical complexity for manufacturing dielectric films, which
            range in thickness from 2 to 12 microns, and require specialized
            equipment and controlled environment, project time lines were
            stretched due to long supply schedules, including for customized
            machinery. The projects underwent external delays, including
            logistical and procedural challenges, and supply-related issues,
            where suppliers had to make extra efforts to live up to the
            company's precise requirements. Also, some transit damages
            necessitated replacement of certain components to make sure that we
            were in a position to deliver the high-quality films that we are
            known for.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
            Both projects are now broadly on track. I'm happy to announce that
            the Barjora unit has started sequential testing and dry runs, which
            will spread over the next coming weeks before we get into the wet
            operations. The Ras Al Khaimah project is also progressing steadily
            with necessary capital resources tied up and construction
            progressing at full swing. Key equipment have already arrived at
            site and are awaiting installation. Furthering our sustainability
            initiatives at Ranjangaon, the supply of lower-cost solar power via
            open access from associate company, TP Mercury Limited, an associate
            venture with Tata Power Limited, commenced operations from October
            1, 2024, leading to significant energy cost savings with benefits
            expected to accrue continuously over the 25-year contract period. I
            must add that in the first 6 months of operation of the supply of
            the solar power, we have actually already saved our investment in
            this associate company. With this, I open the floor for question and
            answers. Thank you so much.

            My name is Vidhi Shah. Sir, my first question is on the capex for
            Barjora and UAE plant. So you said that Barjora is running its trial
            testing right now. So when do we expect commercial operations for
            both? And also, can I know the revenue potential of both these
            plants?

            A question point number one is, as I said, the dry runs have
            started. They will progress over the next 3-4 weeks. I would
            imagine. And after that, assuming all goes well, we would be heading
            towards the wet runs. Most of the components are in place. One of
            the damaged components is awaiting a replacement, and it should come
            in sometime by 15th of June or thereabouts. But that would simply be
            replaced. We are going ahead with the trials to make sure all else
            is perfect and ready to operate. That is one.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
            Ras Al Khaimah project, the construction is going on. We would
            actually be in a position to complete and start the dry runs at that
            site only sometime in the last quarter of this calendar year. And it
            will then start thereafter.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
            Revenue potential depends a lot on how the market moves into thinner
            films. So the revenue potential is really enormous, but we would put
            it at give me a moment. The revenue potential, depending on the
            thickness, but to start with would be in the range of INR 150 crores
            to INR200 crores when we start the commercial production. And then
            they would go on as we stabilize on thinner films.

            Madam, margin is a question which I think is a highly competitive
            business, highly competitive area, and perhaps not a correct
            question, or correct for me to answer on an investor call. Margins
            in-- see, margins are different in our two businesses. The Coex
            business of the sheets and the cast films, as I've said often, it's
            a relatively lower-margin business, whereas the dielectric films are
            relatively higher-margin businesses. And the spread, I can give you
            ranges. The spread on the Coex businesses is anywhere between 5% to
            7% at the EBITDA level. And the spread on the capacitor film
            businesses, depending on the thicknesses, is anywhere between 30% to
            50%.

            Let me explain this to you. There are two things here. One, I think
            the EBITDA margin for the company as a whole is not at the number
            that you said. That is the number of around 6% is more realistic of
            -6%-7% is more realistic for the Coex businesses. You were talking

            No, no, no. Sir, my observation is basically, if you see for the
            last 4-5 quarters now, the margin from whatever, 15%-16% that you
            reported is down to 8%. So my question was from that angle at the
            company level.

            Two things, two things, two things, let me explain. I will not one
            is that if you see the share of the Coex business in the overall
            turnover, it's gone up steeply compared to the previous year. Now it
            means a big the growth substantially in turnover has entirely come
            from the lower EBITDA business, which itself, therefore, pushes down
            the weighted average EBITDA.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
            But that said, during the year, we have ourselves, as I have also
            said in earlier press releases and the like, that over the years, we
            have made price adjustments in anticipation of the capacity coming
            in. So the play is really dual.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
            Now this has been so far driven more by a strategic pricing
            principle rather than by a market compulsion. Remember, India is
            still importing substantial percentage of its total requirement of
            capacitor films. And nonetheless, with our capacities coming in, we
            felt there was a need to make sure that we were holding customers.
            And therefore, we also went into price adjustments, which obviously
            would reflect in the overall EBITDA.

            Okay. So between FY '25 and FY '24, you're saying there is a pricing
            adjustment, which is willingly done by you on the dielectric film

          <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
            Correct. And you will appreciate that, A we are in this game as a
            long-term game. We are not the fly-by-night operator where you say
            today, you get an opportunity, and you go by an opportunistic
            pricing. So definitely, India is still importing huge volumes. So
            there is no change in market circumstances in the country. However,
            the fact remains that we are getting two lines coming in.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
            I will also readily add that our strategy on pricing has been driven
            by one other criteria. I'll only mention this as a driver without
            going into super details. You see our Barjora line is delayed, as
            you are aware, from where we should have been to that where we are.
            What this has resulted in is that the gap between the commissioning
            of our two new capacities is going to be lesser than what we would
            have liked it to be. That circumstance means that we will have
            lesser time to ramp up to the two lines and therefore, we thought we
            should prepare for it by pricing adjustments to start with. This is
            part of a larger strategy.

            Manan. Sorry, I heard it as Manoj. My apologies. You see price is
            you asked a very, very relevant question. In the polymers business,
            price is actually always determined by two elements. One is the
            value add, or whatever you are adding in your own shop floor. And B,
            what are the fluctuations in the raw material prices.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
            Now fluctuations in the raw material prices are generally in the
            nature of pass-throughs. You might have timing differences. But
            other than that, it's a pass-through ultimately. Sometimes you get
            the pass-through contractually, sometimes you have to work on the
            pass-through. It depends on customer to customer.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
            So the price is determined and dependent upon two things. One of
            which is the raw material price, which I must tell you is entirely,
            or substantially, dependent on crude price. For example, today, you
            are at a situation where crude prices are going downwards and the
            President of the United States seems to have a desire to take it
            down to $30, $40. Should that happen, polymer prices would move
            downwards correspondingly.

            However, the polymers that we use in the dielectric film business
            are very special. They are not commodity polymers. And being
            non-commodity polymers, the price is not a direct relation to the
            crude price. In a commodity polymer, it would more or less have
            that. You could chart it, and you would see it. Here, there is --
            because of technology, there is a rarity cost to the polymers that
            go into the dielectric films. On the other hand, if I were to take
            our Coex businesses, yes, the prices would be more or less directly
            related to crude.

            Yes, yes, Romil, actually, there's some confusion. Sir, one question
            was on the margins in this quarter. So probably I think the last
            person, you mentioned that because there has been a strong growth on
            the Coex side, and the pricing cut that you have taken
            competitively. So that is the reason why probably the overall
            margins are lower. And probably when you start taking price hikes,
            then probably the margins will come back. That's the right
            understanding, right?
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="space-y-2">
          <div class="flex items-baseline space-x-2">

          </div>
          <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
            Two things. One, you are right on what you said. And also, see, for
            example, as we mentioned, our Coex business grew in the last year by
            25%, which is really substantial. So and that is almost the entire
            revenue growth more or less has come from that segment. So
            obviously, on a weighted average basis, the weighted average EBITDA
            would go down, right? Point number one.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
            Point number two, which is also important and remember, I'm talking
            all this on a stand-alone. When we come to the Consol what was the
            impact of the Consol I'll explain separately for all gentlemen on
            the call all gentlemen and ladies on the call. You see, so that was
            one.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
            Secondly, yes, there is a value-add chain. So now when the value add
            on the dielectric resumes, or picks up back again, the extent to
            which the weighted average would go up would depend on how well the
            Coex business continues to do. So I would really like that, that
            also does well. So we would like to earn more money in the absolute.
            I'm not just worried about the EBITDA percent. I hope, Romil, you
            appreciate what I'm saying.

            Yes. So sir, I have two questions and two parts -- different parts
            for it. Number one, sir, I wanted to get an idea from the demand and
            supply perspective. I understand you mentioned in the call that the
            overall India demand is about 15,000 tons and let's say, you have
            33% market share, I guess a peer of us is having similar capacity.
            So two of you meets about, let's say, 50% of the demand, right?

          <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
            We have a line coming up in Barjora, let's say, a few weeks or a
            month or 2. So that's another, let's say, 30,000 tons. I'm just
            trying to understand the strategy of ramping up how are you expected
            to ramp up this line? I'm just trying to understand how we...

          <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
            Right. So there are multiple points here. Yes, today, we meet about
            30% of the Indian demand. And with the lines coming in. We would be
            remember, our second new line is coming up in RAK that is actually
            geared for global markets, although we could also use it for Indian
            markets.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
            Now the important thing is, A, what are we chasing when we put up
            new capacity? The first thing that we are chasing is the imports. So
            obviously, that's ready those are ready fruits available for the
            plucking, you might get a portion of it, you might not get a portion
            of it. But that's certainly one element that we are chasing as are
            competitors.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
            Two, we are also chasing the imported metalized films, which are
            coming in into India. Today, the films our films are sold and
            metallized. People also import metallized films. Several new
            metallizers are being put up in India at this point of time. So
            those would also be obvious that import of the metallized films is
            also an obvious market for us.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
            Capacitor manufacturers themselves are expanding right now for that
            to meet their own markets. Natural market for us. I can tell you
            that at least two of the big guys making capacitors in India are
            working on at least 50% capacity enhancement, which are about to go
            on stream. And these are actually customers who are 100% dependent
            on us at this point of time, out of Indian film.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
            I also go on to add that there has been certain changes in
            government policy. For example, a couple of years ago, they had the
            Quality Control Order, which applied to capacitors. The application
            of the QCO on capacitors meant that the Indian people who were
            importing huge volumes of capacitors actually had to switch to
            Indian. That was the jump which first drove also the creation of
            more metallizers in the country.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
            So there are ready markets. It's not that capacity is being created
            for non-existent markets. Capacities are being created. And
            obviously, there are strategies in place to load the lines ASAP.

            Sir, let me put it to you this way, we are focused producers who
            like to believe that we are selling on our strengths. We do not take
            pleasure in selling out of anybody else's problems. So let me assure
            you, we are probably the only people who compete with that peer whom

            We don't want to be happy at somebody else's misfortune. It's a

            we have, as a policy, not adopted an opportunistic pricing. Some
            people I know have done it. Those of you who are in the packaging
            business would have seen that already, but that's not the way we can
            operate.

          <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
            Also bearing in mind, remember always that we are in a B2B segment.
            We are not in a sell to trade and supply market at all. If we had a
            trade market, probably one could have done opportunistic. But our
            products are especially dielectric films, are all B2B. And there, we
            don't adopt an opportunistic pricing as a principle. And believe me,
            sir, that has held us in good stead over many years. People respect
            those relationships.

            the shift towards manufacturing for capacitors in India could be?
            You might be talking with your customers because of these PLI
            components and you have some quite big MNC clients. I'm just trying
            to understand how PLI components could change more domestic sourcing
            from India for dielectric films? So if you could just touch upon

            You see, sir, PLI is just a financial incentive to motivate
            investment in quality products. So let's remember that as a driver,
            that's a reward for the work you are doing and enables you to be
            globally competitive.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
            The important point is the trust that the government has given as a
            policy to export of electronic components and systems from India.
            The PLI is just one measure towards encouraging the export. The
            Prime Minister has himself announced a big drive towards export of
            electronic components. And capacitors is one of the very basic
            electronic components and one in which India is very much advanced
            in the technology and manufacture.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
            So I would reasonably see that as part of India's drive on
            electronic components exports, capacitors would definitely see a big
            thrust. Besides capacitors, you will also see export of metallized
            film in a big way because those are demands that we are seeing from
            all over the globe. So yes, this will definitely happen. Government
            policy is encouraging it. PLI is the icing on the cake.

            Yes. Sorry, the last question, I just wanted to touch upon the
            global supply and demand space. I mean, a lot of global players,
            let's say, ex of China, are also putting up incremental lines. So
            I'm just trying to understand what's the current demands-supply
            scenario? I mean, is there enough demand to absorb all these
            upcoming lines? And could the oversupply situation may come, let's
            say, down 2, 3 years' time because our new line, especially the
            Dubai line is export oriented? Just...

            You're right. You're absolutely right. Capacity is coming up.
            Substantial capacity is there in China, existing and the growth and
            fresh capacity is China. The fortunately, or unfortunately, however,
            the world is today working on a China Plus One theory in some
            places, they are working on a China eliminate China theory. I don't
            think that will ever happen, eliminate China. It could be a China
            Plus One.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
            We are quite clear that our drive is to capitalize on the China Plus
            One theory as we grow forward. And on a global market situation,
            that is the reason why we have a UAE plant. The UAE plant is well
            located strategically from a saving point, from a delivery point for
            supplies to the Western world, which means Europe and U.S.A.

            A point which is very well known, for example. U.S.A. itself does
            not manufacture base dielectric films. The base dielectric films
            there are all imported from somewhere. It is China, no doubt. It is
            Europe. It's us to a small extent with a little bit that we are able
            to do. So that is actually a huge opportunity. And I think that's
            very interesting.

            That I think is something very relevant. And believe me, that's an
            extremely interesting and a tricky situation. You see the way things
            look, the highest punitive duty would be on China, followed by
            India, perhaps, the way one imagines. Should that happen, we will
            have an edge over China. And yes, India will lose its edge over,
            say, Europe, a European supplier.

            However, that's where our Middle East plant comes into play. Because
            right now, he's not even talking about huge success on Middle East.
            So our Middle East will then come into play for supplies to, say,
            the U.S. So from a very self-mercenary perspective, I'm looking like
            what happens to me, I -- probably and what happens to our business
            in isolation of the rest of the world. would not like to say we are
            not part of the global Indian situation, we are.

            But if a sense is applied on capacitor films in particular, on China
            and on India, the way they are talking, believe me, it would help
            India. And it would help us a little bit more when the Middle East
            plant goes on stream. And if there is nothing called a stress well,
            then we are no worse than where we are today.
