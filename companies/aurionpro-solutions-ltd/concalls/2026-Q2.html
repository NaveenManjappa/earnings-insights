            Thank you. Thanks and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for
            joining us on this call for Q2 and H1 Earnings.
            <br /><br />
            This quarter was another strong step forward for Aurionpro. Revenue
            grew 29% year-on-year, as you would have seen, and our industry
            leading EBITDA and PAT margins remain resilient. These results are
            not incidental. They are about discipline. They are about focus and
            conviction of 3000+ Aurionites across the globe. They are about our
            belief that great technology built with purpose can still reshape
            industries and nations.
            <br /><br />
            We added 19 new logos in Q2, bringing our first half tally to 35.
            This is the strongest new logo addition in our history, and that
            speaks to the depth of demand across all of our businesses and the
            trust our customers place in us.
            <br /><br />
            In Banking and FinTech, the UCO Bank engagement was a significant
            defining win for our AI led transaction banking platform. It
            reinforces our position as the platform as well as the partner of
            choice for large financial institutions. We continue to expand
            banking with wins across Sri Lanka, Middle East, and Africa,
            extending our global reach. Our product groups across transaction
            banking, lending, and Interact each had significant first half, not
            just in terms of business numbers, but also new product buildouts.
            AI is now at the core of everything we build in Banking, not
            decoration, but real differentiator, helping our clients decide
            faster and operate smarter.
            <br /><br />
            In TIG, which is the technology innovation group, the two phases of
            Mumbai Metro project that we won is the largest order win in our
            history. They further confirm Aurionpro's leadership in India's AFC
            and smart mobility markets. Our Data Center business as well
            continues to see strong demand and growth in the first half.
            <br /><br />
            Four years ago, we made a hard and deliberate choice. We moved away
            from the safety of what was a diversified services business with
            some product into building a global products and platforms company
            rooted in deep engineering, rooted in R&D. In an industry that is
            dominated by IT services, I am not sure how many appreciate how hard
            that is. That choice was not easy, but we made the choice and it
            changed our trajectory.
            <br /><br />
            Since that pivot four years back, we have invested more than Rs.
            1,000 crore in new product development and in strategic
            acquisitions. These were bold, forward-looking bets that prepared us
            to compete and to win in the world that is now emerging today. Doing
            30% plus annual growth for four years in a row is very, very rare in
            India's listed tech sector. It reflects the power of our strategy,
            our products, and our people.
            <br /><br />
            Enterprise software is today being rebuilt around AI systems that
            interpret, reason, and act. This is not an incremental change, it is
            foundational, and it is imperative that we act ahead of the curve on
            this change. As we enter the second half of FY'26, we will double
            down our product build-outs and R&D guided by three imperatives. One
            rebuilding the enterprise stack for AI, creating the data, model,
            and agent infrastructure that defines an intelligent enterprise.
            Second is to build next-generation AI native applications.
            Applications that think, plan, and execute with intelligence. Third
            is scaling the capability at speed which we need to. Expanding our
            engineering depth, where we need to, as well as global alliances to
            deliver faster than anyone else as we run this race.
            <br /><br />
            Our AI labs in Mumbai, Paris, and London are advancing applied AI,
            data architecture, and agentic computing and you should expect
            path-breaking announcements from these labs in the time to come.
            <br /><br />
            Our home markets in Asia continue to grow strongly, and U.S.
            continues to register steady performance. We also continue to push
            very hard in Europe. I have talked about this in the previous calls.
            We have made major investments in Europe over the past few quarters,
            building the teams, infrastructure, and partnerships we need. The
            pipeline is building up nicely, but we know that success in new
            markets takes discipline and takes patience, and we are determined
            to execute with both.
            <br /><br />
            As we enter the second half of FY'26, we are doing so from a
            position of strength. We continue to have industry-leading margins,
            as you have seen, a strong balance sheet, and a rapidly expanding
            global footprint. We will continue to invest boldly in our products,
            into market expansions, and in applications, in the data center and
            AI spaces, while maintaining our financial discipline and
            operational rigor. With that, I will hand this back and let us bring
            on the questions. Thank you.

              Hello. Hi, sir, congratulations on a great set of numbers. Just a
              few questions from my side. A) in terms of Europe and US, when can
              we start seeing some traction in terms of deal wins and what is
              our strategy there? I think we have hired a lot of people, so how
              are we shaping up in that region?

            <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
              Hey, Vinay. Hi. Thanks. So, look, we are already seeing traction
              in terms of some initial wins. We have seen traction in terms of
              pipeline build-out, but typically large deals in this business,
              the sales cycle is 12 to 18 months. I think we are six months into
              our expansion into Europe. US is a more steady state, so I will
              probably cover that separately. But Europe, you are right, we
              invested significantly first half of the year, as well as Q4 last
              year, in terms of building out the team that Tom runs. A pretty
              strong sales team. We also did an acquisition in the form of
              Fenixys. So, that is s a lot of investments that have gone into
              Europe. I think last quarter we announced the first deal win in
              Europe, which was an AI-led lending solution win. I think we are
              probably a few weeks away from going live there. Getting into any
              new market, one has to be prepared to initially climb over. Just
              because we are strong in Asia does not mean we have a right to win
              in Europe. We obviously have great solutions, but we need to build
              out the local references, we need to build out the local
              partnerships. So, I think we have gone about building this
              methodically. As we slowly take the initial set of wins live, we
              build on those differences and the flywheel takes over. So, I
              think we are probably another four quarters away from the flywheel
              fully in operation. But you already started seeing some wins, and
              I think you will see more as we get towards Q4.

              And on AI, like Arya, I just want to understand, we have three
              labs set up. So, the focus is to build an AI company within
              Aurionpro, or is banking the only target from an AI perspective? I
              just want to understand that.

            <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
              So, Arya, there is a reason why we keep Arya as a standalone
              AI-focused business inside Aurionpro. I think if you look at AI
              today, what is it that you are trying to do? I think there are
              three races you're trying to run. One is the AI native
              applications, which is where you say the enterprise application,
              the classic software mode is getting disrupted, a new mode is
              getting created in the software. That is a race we are determined
              to play well in to win. And one is that race, which is how do you
              bring together a very mature AI framework into the application?
              This is where you see us. You have already seen us register a lot
              of wins because we are AI first in terms of transaction banking,
              in terms of lending, but you will see a lot more coming out in
              terms of our vision of what that AI native application looks like
              and that is not far away. So, that is race number one. Race number
              two is if you did not start at the application layer. So,
              historically in the industry, most of the money, once the
              technology matures, has been made on the application layer. We
              feel very good about that. And that is where we will focus a lot
              more. But if you did not start there and you start at what
              intelligence is of the most value to the enterprise, which is
              where we are building out a whole enterprise AI layer, including
              the MCP orchestration that it needs, including the domain specific
              elements that it needs to come in and start at the intelligence
              level inside the enterprise. So, that is race number two that Arya
              has to run. And number three is can we really create new
              foundational technology that allows banks, financial institutions,
              enterprises to take these models into production? Data to model is
              very easy. Model to production is very hard. There is a lot. There
              is millions of toy applications sitting in sandbox boxes around
              the world. It takes a lot in terms of taking a model to
              production. So, we are doing some. This is where the labs in
              Paris, London, Mumbai come in. Can we do deep research? Can we
              come up with net new foundational technology? Some of this I do
              not want to talk about right now, but over the next, I think, very
              near future, we will come and talk about it once we publish the
              papers and once we have sort of launched some of these. But the
              right kind of technology to bring models into production, put
              guardrails on it, observability around it. We run probably one of
              the top four or five explainability labs on the planet today. We
              run the top research labs when it comes to this technology. And
              that is race number three. That is more future looking. And that
              is probably going after a much bigger price. But that is obviously
              a harder problem to solve as well. So, those are the three races
              that we are trying to run. I think there is a lot of, the whole AI
              space is a lot of noise. There is a lot of bluster. There is a lot
              of claims getting made. I think we intend to sort of focus on more
              net new value that we can add, you know, keep the noise level low.
              And we will continue to push towards these three.

              Okay. And just a few things on the numbers. Our margins are on the
              lower band of 20 to 22, which we guide for. So, any operating
              leverage could play out maybe in the next, you know, 4-6 quarters
              and things like that.

              Look, operating leverage always keeps playing out, right. But the
              scale of our R&D spend also keeps on increasing. So, I have been
              very clear about that. We have no intention of going after EBITDA
              maximization anytime over the next few years. Right. I think that
              is something you do when you go to you start saying is my growth
              6% or 6.5% or 6.6%. You know, I think when you are growing at 30%,
              you are pushing new product out, getting into new markets. I think
              the focus has to be to build product, to win clients, to grow the
              business sometime in the future over the next few years. If we
              feel that, you know, the market has matured, we matured, the
              growth rates are coming down, then we will think of EBITDA. Right
              now, what we do is we try to keep EBITDA at the band. And as the
              operating leverage comes in and the business becomes more
              profitable, we pour the excess back into the R&D bucket. Right.
              So, the R&D bucket this year is probably Rs. 120 crore, maybe
              slightly more than that and I think it will continue to increase.

              Just one last thing, like our cash flows for H1 were negative and
              last year, also, it was a similar case and we saw great collection
              in H2. So, that is the nature of the business, as we understand.
              And can we expect something similar for this year also? Like we
              will maintain the OCF EBITDA margin?

              Okay, so look, I think on the cash question, it is the same. I
              think it is the same situation every year, right? So, like I said,
              it is pretty much the same question every year. But the nature of
              the business is such that we do a lot of deal bookings, you know,
              towards Q4 of the year, a lot of project startups, you know, Q4,
              beginning of the year, and typically most project go-lives take
              12-14 months. And unfortunately, billing milestones are linked to
              client go-lives in this business. I mean, if it is an IT services
              business, you know, it is like month to month and all that stuff
              is fine. But in the product business, that is the nature of the
              business. Some of that seasonality is coming down. But typically
              for us, middle of the year, you are still executing projects. End
              of the year, you take the clients live and the collections pick
              up, right? So, I think we basically last couple of years against
              exactly the same picture. I think we have typically converted, I
              would say 75% to 80% or more EBITDA to cash by the time we finish
              the year. Maybe even more, I think 90% plus last year, if you net
              out the tax. So, typically collections towards, you know, become
              very strong towards Q4. But middle of the year, while projects are
              getting executed, it is a big peak. But it is the same question
              and answer every year. Hopefully that answers.

              Hello, good morning. Thanks for the opportunity and
              congratulations on good set of results, sir. I have a question on
              data center. So, how do we see our data center business growing in
              the next couple of years? Maybe in terms of revenue share, client
              profile, along with the services offered? And what all other
              agencies are we planning to explore in this ecosystem?

            <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
              Yes, hi Kunal. Thanks for the question. So, look, data center is
              one of the big bets for us over the last few years. So, four or
              five years back, you see that business was zero for us. It has
              been growing very, very strongly, typically in the range of
              anywhere between I would say 35% and 50% any given year. So, it is
              one of those businesses where there is so much demand that you can
              grow at pretty much any rate that you want. We are very methodical
              in terms of how we want to grow that business. So, I think
              typically the business will continue to grow strongly, but we are
              very selective in who we work with. We work with a few strategic
              partners. I mean, Iron Mountain being one of them where we do more
              or less everything for them in terms of their project execution.
              We run one of the top data center design teams in the country. So,
              we work after several complex design projects. That is very good
              work. And then we have been working on some R&D in terms of
              building out our IP, building out some products in the space, also
              partnerships in the space. So, we like non-linearity of the
              product business, so we will slowly bring some products out. So,
              data center is where Transit was probably six or seven years back.
              We started off in a pure services way, learned the business, then
              built our IP across every point on the value chain. I think data
              center is still doing it. It will continue to grow strongly over
              the next few years and we will continue to be very selective on
              the business and the partnerships we take on. We will continue to
              work on our internal R&D in terms of where we can add net value in
              terms of IP we can build out. So, that is essentially where the
              business is. We feel very, very good about it. It is one of our
              big bets, and I think it will continue to grow very strongly.

              Okay. In terms of the overall mix, as in the last call as well,
              you have given a hint that it is one third of the TIG business.
              So, are we seeing this mix to change over the next couple of
              years, maybe, given the high growth?

            <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
              Yes, so look, I think the challenge is, I think probably it will
              go up in the mix purely because of the fact that the public sector
              side may come down a little bit. But I think the problem with the
              mix question in terms of high growth businesses is the other parts
              of TIG, so especially the transit payment side also continues to
              grow very strongly globally, as well as other parts of the banking
              side as well. So, how does the relative mix change? I think that
              is a slightly tougher question. And I would really be speculating,
              but I would say in the TIG business, the mix should go up from one
              third, logically, over the next few years. I mean, it is will
              continue to grow strongly. What does that become? Does it become
              half? I do not think so. But I think it will go up above the one
              third.

              Got it. Thank you. Another question on the SaaS part. So, how do
              we see the SaaS growth in terms of the annuity revenues over the
              next couple of years?

            </div>
            <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
              Yes, so look, I think we actually license most of our software in
              enterprise form. So, that is why the SaaS thing is a little bit,
              it does not do justice to the portfolio. We normally make large
              software core systems for tier one banks, which is typically goes
              in enterprise license space. The same software where we go to
              NBFCs or lower tier of the banks, we sell in a SaaS model. So,
              SaaS for us is a commercial model. Obviously, all our products are
              relatively modern and cloud native and can go in either of the
              formats. What do we feel about the software side? I think the
              software side has been growing strongly. The goal that we have, so
              I have only two asks from any product business inside Aurionpro.
              Ask number one is product superiority. How are we better than who
              it is that we compete with? I do not want to be naming competitors
              over the earnings call, but for transaction banking, for lending,
              you know who the competition is. How are we going to be better? It
              does not need to be 100 points. It is usually three or four. That
              goes into the roadmap. Roadmap goes to the product. That is ask
              number one. Ask number two is never fail a customer. Aurionpro has
              a reputation for making customers successful. Once we take
              something on, we make sure the customer gets the value from what
              they buy from us. The IT world is littered with failed projects,
              which is what makes a lot of the market fairly weak. We have built
              a reputation over time. And that is the reason for, you know, if
              you look at the transaction banking win that I announced, we win
              most of the Indian large bank deals on transaction banking these
              days. Why is that? It is because we never fail a customer. So,
              those are the only two asks. I think as long as we stay true to
              our purpose, build products that are fundamentally superior to the
              market, we will continue to grow these strongly. Transaction
              banking, we are one of the top platforms in the world today. I
              mean, in terms of platform, we are obviously market-wise strong in
              Asia, going into Europe and US. Lending, we are one of the top
              platforms in the world today. Enterprise AI, we have run one of
              the sort of most mature enterprise AI frameworks around, one of
              the deepest, widest teams in the business, and we will continue to
              mature. So, I feel good about the software business and longer
              run, I think one of the earlier questions was around operating
              leverage. I mean, software is beautiful in that sense. I think as
              we scale the business, the operating leverage really lands a lot
              more cash in the company. And then we use that. You can choose to
              stop growing and collect the cash, but we use it for R&D, we use
              it for acquisitions. I mean, over the last four odd years since we
              pivoted, we have invested more than a thousand crore behind R&D
              and acquisitions. And that is the beauty of the software business,
              right? So, it continues to get stronger as we scale it.

              Yes, perfect. Hi, Ashish. So, one question would be your employee
              expenses have risen both on a y-on-y basis as well as a percentage
              of revenue. Now, previous quarter you mentioned that there was a
              large impact due to employee wage hikes. So, my question is, will
              this be the new normal? Or is this just an aberration because of
              elevated investments in the EMEA region? Number one.

            <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
              Yes, so look, employee expenses, they did jump. Overall, I would
              say Rs. 9 crore - Rs. 10 crore or so. So, I think it is like it
              has gone up. A lot of it is due to sort of absorption of that came
              through some acquisitions, right? So, some of it has gone up
              because of that, because the net headcount has gone up. And some
              of the other part is in some parts of the business, we have been
              scaling up. EMEA is one where we have been scaling up. And some of
              the new order wins like MMRDA, etc. They do need us to capacitize.
              Those are very large orders where we need to capacitize, right?
              So, I think it has gone up. Would it go up at that same pace the
              next few quarters? I do not think so. So, I think acquisition is
              one of those things where it does go up in chunks when we sort of
              close the acquisition in a quarter. But I think organic growth
              wise, it will not be that much.

              You are implying that it should normalize. All right, my next
              question would be, could you share any update on your
              conversations with analysts? Like Gartner or Forrester, any new
              conversations?

            <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
              Of course. So, look, I think that is a great question.
              Historically, we have not really spent a lot of time with
              analysts. So, it is mostly in the last four to six quarters that
              we have actually had a strong engagement with most of the
              analysts. Now we are covered by just about everyone. So, if you
              look at, and it depends on the product set, so lending, of course,
              was covered earlier. Chartis, we are squarely for corporate loan
              origination, for collateral management, for limit management in
              the banking book. We are squarely up north, leader's quadrant
              worldwide. IDC covered us on the lending side. Again, IDC
              Marketscape featured up north, leader's quadrant worldwide. And
              they covered us for the first time maybe a few months back. So, I
              think lending is well covered. We started getting coverage with
              Gartner, Forrester, etc. as well. I think we got the initial
              coverage. Of course, you know, it takes time to start featuring in
              the leader's quadrants. But we started coverage for transaction
              banking. We feel very strongly we have the strongest product in
              the world today. So, It is a matter of time before we start
              sharing up north, similar to the lending. In those cases, we let
              the analysts take their time. We also had on transaction banking,
              we were named the platform, I think by IBSI, the platform of the
              year or something like that. So, I think there is a lot of success
              on the analyst front for the core platforms and you will see more
              and more of those as the analyst coverage matures. So, that is a
              top focus for us, especially as we go into Europe and US because,
              you know, what a Chartis thinks or what a Gartner thinks does
              matter and we have these strengths.

              So, look, I think it is like, look, it is not everything, but it
              is a useful point. And I think the philosophy that we have is head
              to head, a pure platform evaluation for the products that we built
              out over the last three years will win against just about
              everyone, right. So, because we have the strength, and the reason
              earlier we were not engaging also is because we were doing the
              build outs. I think now that we have the strength, we win most
              technical evaluations on our core platforms these days. So, if you
              said only platform superiority was a factor, how functional, how
              deep the platform is, how modern it is, how micro services enabled
              it is, how intelligence enabled it is, you know, how many
              intelligence innovations exist on the product stack, we usually
              win those games very, very well. So, since the products are there,
              and we have the lead, it makes sense to do that. Is it everything?
              It is not everything, right. But I think it is an important
              decision factor for most buying organizations. And I think we are
              very serious about it. So, you will see more and more of that
              coverage come out.

              Yes, sorry. I just had a couple of Internet issues. Thank you for
              the opportunity and congratulations on a good result. I have a
              couple of questions. The first is sort of on the back of what
              somebody else asked relating to the TIG segment. What are you
              seeing the most traction in? Is it data centers? Is it the
              transit? And if you could give us a current breakup of what this
              quarter looked like, whether there was more performance from data
              centers or more performance from the transit.

              Yes, so look, TIG continues to grow strongly. I think it is like
              hard to choose, but both transit payments as well as data center
              they grew very strongly in first half of the year. Transit, of
              course, had that huge win with MMRDA, which will probably propel
              stronger growth rates for some time. It is also because it is a
              great deal with full hardware to software play and so I think it
              is a crucial win for us. So, transit probably will accelerate
              faster on the back of that. But I think it is hard. I think both
              the businesses are growing. Within TIG, data center is growing
              very, very strong. Transit payments is going very strong. And the
              public sector side of it is, I think, as I have explained
              previously before, it is steady and we have scaled it down a
              little bit. So, overall, that is what I would say on the mix.

              Okay. And just my next question is, within the reporting segments
              that are there, the sale of software services, we have seen a bit
              of a sequential downward movement. If you could just speak on that
              a little bit. And if you could comment on what the execution time
              period is for the order book that has been given of about Rs.
              1,500 crore at the end of Q2. What is the execution timeline for

            </div>
            <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
              So, okay, two different parts. I think the way to look at the sale
              of software services versus license and equipment, the reason we
              declared it, the way to look at it is more largely what is one-off
              versus what is more of a continuous stream. I think it is
              important not to look at mix from one quarter to the other,
              because, for example, in this quarter, because of MMRDA, that
              equipment and licensing piece jumped quite a bit. So, there will
              be, like, from one quarter to the other, depending on the mix of
              business, that number will go up and down. But I think the way to
              look at it is, what is largely a one-off going in and what is sort
              of more continuous in terms of the business. I think that is how I
              would look at it anyways. On the order book, so typically the way
              we declare our order book, we do not really have, for example, the
              AMC streams inside it and a lot of the recurring stuff inside it,
              which will get added every year as we get into it. So, I would say
              80% plus of the order book is typically executable over the next
              five to six quarters. I think that is generally the mixes. There
              will be some 20-odd percent which will sort of go a lot further
              because there is always a tail to several orders.

              understand what exactly, I mean, what is the scope of work in the
              data center? And apart from that, per megawatt whatever investment
              is being done in data center, so our scope would constitute what

              Okay. So, I am not sure if I got the first part of the question
              correctly, but I thought you said, what do we do in the data
              center space? And then you said, what is the sort of margin
              profile? Look, I think what we do, we run one of the top data
              center design teams in the country. We specialize in the complex
              end of design. I think that is our specialization. That is usually
              fairly high margin work. As a percentage of the overall pie, it is
              not significant. It is single digit. We also program, manage the
              build of data centers for a few strategic partners, which is where
              the size gets bigger. Right, I think on the overall margin profile
              standpoint, of course, there is a massive demand in that space,
              but we are very selective on the deals that we take on. And that
              is largely got to do with us being very careful around the margin
              profile of the business that we take on. The longer term ambition
              is to build more products in that space, which we are slowly
              building out. And I think then the margin profile will, of course,
              change. But that will take some time for us to mature the
              products. In the meanwhile, I would say data center is probably
              five or six points below the enterprise margin at the moment. And
              continues to grow at about enterprise levels. I mean, slightly
              above the enterprise levels at the moment.

              So, I got confused. So, the margin profile of data center is five

            <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
              Correct. I think the way to look at it is we have been steadily
              investing in that business as well. Plus, it is largely a
              services-led business at the moment, right? So, in many ways, if
              you look at it, any business that we enter initially, we normally
              enter as a services business, like transit six or seven years back
              when we entered purely services business, you know, validators
              from one place, gates from somewhere else, AFC payment system
              somewhere else, software from somewhere else. But then slowly, we
              go and find places where we feel there is value extraction that
              can happen with IP. We understand the space well enough, then we
              build it, and then we go for it, right? So, slowly, we like
              non-linear play that IP allows. So, slowly, any business, we will
              try to productize it. But at the moment, it is largely a
              services-led business.

              I understand. And my second question is on your overall growth. I
              mean, just wanted to understand when we say a 30% kind of growth,
              so what are the growth drivers, I mean, geographically as well as
              segmentally? And how will this growth profile change over next
              year, let us say FY'27? Because you did mention that we are
              stressing more on Europe and US market. So, just wanted to
              understand this trajectory. I mean, what is driving the growth in
              the current year, and how will this change over the next year?

            <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
              So, look, it is not any single year that we have been growing 30%,
              right? I think we basically have grown at something between 30%
              and 35%, 36% over the last four years. So, four years back, we
              pivoted the business away from what was largely a diversified,
              some products, largely services play into what we are today, which
              is where we said we will choose a set of segments. I would highly
              recommend you watch one of the few Investor Day videos that should
              be available somewhere. But if I was to summarize it, we said we
              will choose segments where we see a demand runway that goes out at
              least six, seven, eight years. Obviously, in the tech industry,
              everyone wants to see a long demand runway. It is very hard to
              find. So, there has to be something fundamentally transformative
              happening in that space for us to get comfortable around the
              demand. There has to be something fundamentally transformative
              happening in that space for us to get comfortable around the
              demand. There has to be a space where we bring some unique
              advantage, and we believe that global leadership is contested. And
              then we published the "Vision 2030". We went after it for lot of
              these spaces. Transit payments is one where we believe over the
              next 10 years, the entire world is going to move from closed-loop
              to open-loop payments, which is tens of thousands of transit
              operators. Data center was another space we felt India was
              under-capacitized. We felt AI computers under-capacitized, and we
              thought that will grow. Enterprise AI was a third area. Lending,
              transaction banking, right? So, we chose spaces quite recently,
              which is four years back when we pivoted, where we knew the demand
              is going to be strong. And then we went about methodically
              building the business. And that is how the business has grown.
              FY'21, when we started this, we were a Rs. 375 crore business.
              FY'22, we were Rs.505 crore. Then 660, 880, 1,200. This year,
              probably something between Rs.1,500 crore and Rs.1,600 crore. So,
              we have basically been growing the business at that pace for the
              last five years. To my knowledge, we are the only listed
              technology organization, at least in this country, who has done
              that over the last five years, grown above 30%, you know,
              consecutively for the last four years. And, you know, that is how
              we do it, right? So, these are segments where we know the demand
              is. Now, obviously, the demand drivers vary for the segment.
              Transaction banking transformation is a huge theme where we see,
              you know, a lot of new logo wins, a lot of demand. The driver for
              data center space is completely different. The driver for transit
              payments is completely different, right? But these are spaces
              which have high demand. And I think we have built out over the
              last few years probably the most competitive set of offerings out
              there. So, now the question is, where do you go from here? I feel
              the core IP for us exists in most of these spaces. Of course, you
              know, there is a whole AI wave that came in after we pivoted. But
              we were aware of it and we have invested against it. And now it is
              a question of continuing to invest in that IP, but also continue
              to expand into markets. We feel very good about where we are in
              Asia. Now the game is, can we become strong in Europe? Can we
              become strong in US, right? So, that is the focus. I do not know
              if that answers the question, but that is the philosophy anyways.

              Look, I do not know what I do not know, right? I mean, businesses
              do not run in a straight line. I think we got good visibility over
              the next four quarters. We intend to grow strongly for the next
              several years. I think we have the business model. I think we have
              the products and the IP. We have methodically built out one of the
              finest teams in this business. And I believe we will continue to
              grow stronger than the industry as we have done over the last four
              years, right? Now, is it exactly 30%? Is it 25? Is it 40? I think
              let us take it one year at a time and let us see. But we feel that
              from now till 2030, we painted a vision 2030 in 2021, which we
              published. So, outside is a qualitative view, inside is a
              quantitative view. I never published the quantitative view outside
              because I do not like making big bold statements saying billion
              dollars or $10 billion. But it is a precise number. Four years in
              a row, we have beaten that, right? So, we feel good about the
              trajectory. We feel good about being able to grow for several
              years.

              Oh, so look, I think it is sort of hard to segregate it at that
              level, a lot of the AI compute. So, we have got one of the more
              specialized shops. I mean, I think we have published some things
              publicly in the past. You know, the sort of high-performance
              compute with IIT Guwahati, with IIT Mumbai. So, we have got a lot
              of expertise in the space. We have got a lot of offerings in the
              space. The whole AI compute build-out is a relatively new thing
              for India right now. And we are a very India-focused data center
              business. So, I think some of it is still getting built out. Right
              now, I would not be able to give a mix. But I think the future
              demand does seem to be building up. So, most of the AI compute, if
              you see where did that get built out, probably even now 70%, 75%
              is still like training workloads going in and those are mostly,
              they have not been in India. I mean, there has been some, you
              know, GPU as a service sort of offerings out there where, you
              know, small model building people have been using the compute. But
              most of the training workloads have been outside. Now, as the
              usage is going up, there is a lot more inferencing workloads which
              need to get executed closer to where the customer is, where the
              user is. And India, obviously, is one of the larger markets out
              there. So, we do see a steady build-out of AI compute as the
              inferencing workloads take over. So, I think that is sort of how I
              would summarize it. I think in the past, it has been small. We
              have been active participants in designing it, working together
              with IITs, lots of places. We do see that building out as we go.
              So, that will pick up and I think we will play a key role in it.

              Yes, so receivables look typically for us, it is usually high at
              this time of the year for us, right. And I think that is
              understandable, especially because we also had some large orders
              in Q2 that we build out against. Compared to March, of course, it
              will probably look higher to you. Compared to September 30th last
              year, I think our DSOs last year were something in the range of
              110 days. Now it is about 100 days. So, I think it is sort of
              steadily gotten better, sorry better is the wrong usage but in
              terms of where the DSOs are. But overall, this time of the year,
              they are usually high and they are high.

              P&L? If you could just throw your thoughts on this.

            <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
              Yes. So, look, the way we operate is obviously we invest a lot
              behind product build outs in this business. Like I said, this year
              it is probably clocking something north of at least 25 a quarter,
              if not closer to 30. But most of that goes into our core large
              products like transaction banking, like lending, like transit
              payments, etc. We do not usually capitalize those build outs. We
              usually expense them out because these are large businesses and
              typically we are quite comfortable with the net margin that comes
              out from it. The only places where we have been capitalizing is,
              as to my knowledge, two places. One is the payments business,
              where I have also said in the previous earnings call as well,
              because we have capitalized. The reason we have is because it is a
              business which is a regulated business. We have asked for licenses
              in some geographies, including India. And there is a sort of asset
              build out that happens that we also need to sort of show that we
              are building the products out. So, that is number one. And the
              second place where we have done some recently is the AI side. Of
              course, we have been investing a lot on that side. But in some
              cases, we are also trying to work together with, let us say,
              government funded agencies in a few countries in Europe, as well
              as in India, where we are looking at grants and all that stuff.
              So, we need to show some asset build out there. That is sort of
              the bulk of it, I would say. Relative to the size of product build
              outs that we do, it is not really material, at least in my view
              and I think these are very specific small businesses inside the
              firm. The other way to look at it, sorry, just to be clear about
              this, right? These are businesses with a very large future. So,
              even relative to the size, so AI, for example, is growing at 100%
              for us. I mean, I do not know what the future size of the business
              is. I do not think anyone knows, but it will become a very large
              business. Same thing with payments as we scale, right? So, these
              are relative to even the future size of these businesses. The size
              of the product build outs actually is fairly small and I think we
              are probably one of the most efficient shops in the world in terms
              of building product, right? Product building takes dollars, takes
              effort, and takes like years of patience, which we have in oodles.
              And that is why for the larger products, there is basically no
              capitalization that we do.

              Understood. And my second question is that if I look at the
              segmental breakup between sale of software and sale of equipment.
              And what you said in an earlier answer is that you would look at
              it like what is one-off versus what is recurring. If I look at
              sale of software, June versus September, it is down from Rs. 252
              crore to Rs. 207 crore and sale of equipment is up from 84 to 150.
              So, it seems extremely lofty. And if sale of software service is
              largely recurring, it should not have fallen so much. So, am I
              missing something in my understanding of this?

            <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
              Yes, so it is like, it is not just software. So, there is a lot of
              services in there, which basically is the size of the projects
              that we do, right? So, a lot of the skew that you see in Q2, for
              example, one single project, which is MMRDA, which you got started
              on, caused a very large skew in terms of moving towards the
              equipment and licensing side, right? So, some of these variations
              will happen from one quarter to the other. I would say do not read
              software and services as pure software. So, we are not big on, for
              example, subscriptions, right? There is obviously always a steady
              stream of AMCs and all that get captured there, which are like
              recurring revenues. But a lot of it is also project
              implementations and services revenue, which will go up and down as
              we close new orders, as we execute on projects. And the mix,
              relative mix between what is license versus what is service will
              also change, right? So, depending on the sales mix in a quarter,
              you will see one of those two going up. If you were skewed towards
              a license, then that line goes up. If it was a very competitive
              deal, the license prices were down, but a lot of loading was
              towards the project work, then that goes up temporarily till the
              project is getting done. Then obviously, you know, that number is
              not there. So, you know, it is not like a SaaS style subscription
              revenue, which you say, okay, how does it vary so much? I mean,
              some of it is like 20% of it is probably recurring or maybe 25,
              but not all of it.

              First of all, sir, congrats on a good set of numbers and the
              continuous momentum. I just wanted to have a view around if I were
              to break down the Banking and the FinTech business unit or the
              vertical as we reported. Could you give some directional view
              around the newer verticals wherein we the NBFC and the FinTech and
              the traditional banking what we were doing? So, could I have some
              flavor around there? How the progress is? Because I understand
              that the NBFC and FinTech were newer products which we had been
              investing on. So, some direction there or some flavor would be
              helpful. And rather a request would be if we reach to a sizable
              amount or a sizable quantum of business in both the businesses
              separately. We could report them separately also.

              Yes. So, longer run, you are totally correct. I think we will
              probably at some point start reporting the businesses separately.
              FinTech, again, you are correct. I think the banking side of it is
              the larger platforms around lending, transaction banking that we
              have. FinTech side is where we have done a lot of new product
              build outs over the last, I would say, five or six quarters. Where
              are we? I think FinTech is becoming more and more material. So,
              obviously, Sanjay Verma, I think he has been on Investor Days
              before. He is the president who runs that business. We have built
              out what we think is probably the most modern retail LO product
              out in the market today. We have come out with it. So, this is
              stuff that does not just go to NBFCs, also goes to banks. So,
              India, of course, we have got a lot of sites for the product.
              Outside of India, we had our first win in Saudi recently, and we
              are implementing it. This is also a fully AI-led product, which we
              feel we are seeing a lot of traction in Europe, at least in terms
              of pipeline buildup, and we do think we will win. So, that
              business will grow. We are very close to coming up with a
              brand-new loan servicing system, probably out over the next three
              months. This, again, will be the most cutting-edge, most modern
              product in the market. We have got a completely new self-service
              portal, largely on the auto side that we came up with four
              quarters back. Already a win in New Zealand, a win in the U.S.,
              and we are looking at probably some wins in Europe this year with
              it. So, I think this, again, is a large auto-finance facing
              product, which I think we will do very well in. The initial wins
              have been very, very strong, very promising. And a lot of sort of
              AI-native application buildout, agentic application buildout in
              that space. For example, we announced the win in the U.K. with an
              SME lender. I think we are probably just a few weeks from going
              live with it. I think once we go live there, that builds up a
              solid local difference that we can build on and expand into Europe
              with. So, there is a lot of new product buildout, I think, in that
              business that has happened over the last four quarters. I think it
              is maturing very fast. Each of these products, I am convinced, are
              today the most modern deep products in the market in their
              respective spaces. And this is going to see a lot of traction,
              especially in terms of new market push that we are seeing in
              Europe as well as in Middle East and Africa. So, I think that is
              how I would sort of summarize it. I hope that answers the
              question.

              Understood. Got it. And so, my second question was around the TIG,
              what we had been trying to sell it across or outside India. So,

              So, outside of India, the primary solution line that goes out is
              the smart mobility transit payment side. That is where I think we
              are enormously successful, right? So, I think the transit payment
              side is almost 50 and 50. Of course, now we won some large deals
              in India, so it may get skewed for some time. But typically, I
              think so, like we had that win in California a few years back,
              full global RFP. We are live in eight or nine Californian cities.
              This is the open loop, the open loop win we had. So, today, if you
              go to Disneyland in California on a holiday and you are doing a
              tap-in, tap-out from your card, you are doing it on an Aurionpro
              validator, the same one you can see in our experience center in
              Mumbai or Singapore. If you go to a holiday in Maldives and you
              take any public mode of transport, the whole technology stack is
              Aurionpro's, of course, in partnership with MasterCard, who funds
              it but the technology solution is ours. You do tap-in, tap-out on
              an Aurionpro unit if you take a ferry or something like that. So,
              America, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, large wins. I think we have
              proven ourselves. We have entered Australia. We entered UK. We
              have proven ourselves as probably the strongest end-to-end
              solution provider in the space. Of course, the very large
              providers in the space tend to be double-digit billion-dollar
              players or multi-billion-dollar players. And we do not have the
              balance sheet to go out and try to compete, for example, a
              billion-dollar tender or something like that. So, we tend to
              collaborate in international deals. We are a very strong partner
              with MasterCard. We recently started partnering with Visa as well.
              So, for example, Maldives was MasterCard. The Egypt win that we
              announced that we are implementing right now is together with
              MasterCard. We are collaborating on a lot of projects there. We
              are now increasingly competing on larger deal sizes across
              Southeast Asia, across Europe, and the international side will
              continue to grow. I think transit we have built out between the
              R&D centers in Istanbul, London, and Singapore, and the
              manufacturing setup in Malaysia and in India, as well as the
              software piece. We have the whole software chain on it. We also
              have a payment license in India, so you have got the payment chain
              getting worked on as well. We have today probably the deepest,
              widest stack in the space. We are probably the most efficient
              producer of software and hardware in that space. And the margin
              profile of the business keeps getting better every year, right?
              So, I think this is in the long run going to be a key powerhouse
              of growth for Aurionpro, and we intend to be one of the bigger
              players around globally, and we will continue to push towards it.

              Understood, sir. And one last question quickly. Specifically in
              the businesses, we have one of the projects, we have one in TIG,
              which is the MMRDA or the metro lines. Sorry, I am hopping up on
              the same question again, but what sort of margin profile are we
              seeing there? Or if you do not want to talk about that ROC profile
              something, because the receivables are usually higher in these
              businesses.

              No, they are not higher in the transit business. I do not agree
              with that. I think it is like, so transit is a beautiful business.
              So, now with the, with our own, we own every point on the value
              chain now. We even down to having our own manufacturing in this,
              right? Our own IP, our own mechanisms, as well as our own
              software. This is the first place we were also clearing out the
              back office software as well. So, the margin profile is very
              strong in the business. I think there is a reason why we can
              pretty much compete and win most deals. So, the reason we were not
              taking on some transit business in India till recently and now we
              got on to take a larger role because we feel very confident about
              the economic profile of this business. Right. And I think it is
              very, very strong and it is getting better. The second way transit
              generally we do not face. So, initially in the setup, you may have
              some milestones to finish to collect some payments during setup
              time. It is not too problematic. But the other thing is, once you
              are running in steady state, then all money goes into an escrow,
              everyone gets their share. So, it is not problematic from a
              payment standpoint at all. So, that is where I would sort of
              contest that view a little bit. Right. So, even if you had a
              little bit of a milestone delivery while you are doing setup, just
              given that the contracts are long, over time, the economics
              improves and over time, the business actually tends to deliver
              fairly strong cash flows. At least that has been our experience.
              We are very selective in the deals that we take on. We have one of
              the most competitive stacks out there, at least in India and I
              think we will only take on business where we feel confident of the
              economic profile.

              Hey Ashish, this is Debashish. Thank you so much for taking our
              question. So, just one follow up question, what Jalaj just asked.
              As far as I understand that in case of TIG is concerned, we are
              the most kind of end to end integrated player where we have the
              hardware capability also, we have the software capability also and
              if I remember correctly, we have put in our hardware manufacturing
              facility in Singapore, I think last year or so. So, just wanted to
              get some sense that what, what is the competitive intensity? What
              is the kind of margin profile? If, if you can compare with your
              competition in India and give us some sense, because what I
              understand initially in your Lucknow projects in metro and all,
              you were not able to take out a very significant margin. So, how
              those things have changed in the recent times?

            <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
              Yes, so look, I think it is important to understand how we sort of
              get in the business. So, if you go back to some of the initial
              deals that we did, right? I mean, one, we said we want to bet on
              the transit payments as a space, right? Why do we want to do it?
              Because the closed loop to open loop movement, you cannot stop. I
              think it is a movement across the world. Over the next eight, ten
              years, tens of thousands of transit operators around the world
              will need to change. This is a fundamentally transformative event
              that happens in the industry 40, 50 years and we intend to play
              it. When we got in, it is like a lot of our competitors right now
              do it, right? You are almost like a system integrator. You are
              taking products from various places, putting it together, and then
              the margin profile is single digits, right? It is not good. But it
              helps you learn the game. That is where we were five, six years
              back. Since then, we have steadily built out. And this is one of
              the only businesses where we built out both the hardware and
              software stack. Why? Because if you really looked at the whole
              value chain, you are able to extract value. You are able to
              capture margins only when you have that integrated
              hardware-to-software play. It is very hard to capture it if you
              play either or. You say, I just do software, I just do hardware, I
              just bring it together. In neither of those places, you get the
              margin profile, and which is what most of our competition in this
              business does. We will drive a very different level of economics
              from just about everyone else. There is a reason why we have such
              strong partnership in the space with MasterCard, with Wix. We have
              announced a few overall. There is a reason why we are a preferred
              partner for everyone because we can do the whole chain, we can do
              parts of the chain, and we can do all of them efficiently. So,
              that is why for the larger products, there is basically no
              capitalization that we do.

            </div>
            <p class="text-slate-700 transcript-text">
              So, look, I think AI, like I said, as a standalone opportunity, it
              is pretty large. So, there are three ways we are playing that
              game. And I said, one is the AI native applications. Application,
              if you look at history of any technology, as the technology
              matures, it does not matter what you are looking at. Ultimately, a
              lot of value capture happens on the application layer. That is
              where we have traditionally been strong. That is where our
              strength is. That is where a real bank uses a real application to
              run its real business process. That is where value gets created.
              That is where value will get captured. We play that game. We are
              good at that game. We will be very strong at it. That is number
              one. The second major play is AI is very new. It is fundamentally
              transformative and there can be a lot of value from a single
              intelligence intervention. It does not need to happen on the
              application layer. It can have the application layer around it.
              But that specific intervention, depending on which lever you go
              for. So, some banks, some financial institutions may want to start
              from that intelligence intervention. Because you say, that is how
              I prioritize value. This is where some of the global AI vendors
              also have been doing work. I do not think this will happen from
              the likes of the services vendors and all, who are kind of making
              API calls to LLMs and do that. You will still need the whole gamut
              of suites. So, the way we built it out is there is a predictive AI
              suite, which is where you use the classic models to actually drive
              predictive algos. You have got the gen AI suite. You have got the
              agent AI suite. And you bring all of them together to see where
              does the value get created in the enterprise. I think standalone,
              at the moment that is a good sized game. I think that is getting
              larger at a furious pace. And that itself Arya will play. And we
              intend to be a strong player in that game. We have got a very
              mature set of offerings around there. The third game, which is
              slightly different, is the foundational technology game. Can we
              come up with a strong solution to the key challenges to taking
              models into production, which is explainability, observability,
              risk, how do you put the guardrails on, even how do you process
              tabular data, for example. So, that is the third play. And I think
              number two and number three, both are pure AI plays. I feel these
              are very, very large plays for us to play or for Arya to play over
              the next several years. That will obviously need a lot. I mean, we
              have got probably one of the strongest teams in the country today.
              But it will need a lot more investment as the field matures.
              Right? I think both are, in my head, they are linked, but they are
              independent races. You do not need to win both of them to be very,
              very large. But we intend to run both of them with very, very
              strong, building a very strong set of assets and play that. Does
              it make sense?

              Thanks, everyone, for joining this call. We will come together
              again next quarter and we will share where the business is. Four
              years back when we started this pivot, there were a set of hard
              choices to make. I think we made the hard choices. I think we have
              proven that the model works. We need to double down on the
              strategy that works. AI is a fundamentally transformative event.
              That is probably happening for the first time in all of our lives.
              We feel that is transformative for how technology is used in an
              enterprise. We will methodically go about building the set of
              assets as well as the applications and we will play the game to
              win. Thank you for taking time to join us today and we will meet
              again next quarter. Thank you.

              Aurionpro delivered a robust Q2 with
              <strong>29% YoY revenue growth</strong>, driven by significant
              wins in both Banking (UCO Bank) and TIG (Mumbai Metro - largest
              ever order). The company continues to validate its pivot from a
              diversified services model to a global products/platforms player,
              investing over ₹1,000 crore in R&D and acquisitions since 2021.
              <br /><br />
              Key themes include a strategic double-down on
              <strong>AI (Arya.ai)</strong> across three layers (Native Apps,
              Enterprise Intelligence, Foundational Tech) and aggressive
              expansion into Europe, where they are currently absorbing setup
              costs with an expectation of a "flywheel effect" in 4 quarters.
              Margins remain industry-leading (20-22%), intentionally capped to
              fuel R&D.
